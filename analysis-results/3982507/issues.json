As far as I can see from tests, in MySQL, primary key columns are created with AUTO_INCREMENT by default, whereas in Sqlite databases the primary key of an insert may not be unique forever if some rows are deleted. As far as I understand, the equivalent of AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL) is AUTOINCREMENT in Sqlite.\nI haven't yet been able to figure out how to use this feature with Sqlite without modifying peewee itself (model._meta.auto_increment doesn't seem to have an effect).\n\nThank you\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/coleifer/peewee/issues/147/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/coleifer/peewee/issues/147/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}]
