As discussed in #1980, MkDocs will ignore files that start with a `.`, but this only applies to top-level directories. It would be great if MkDocs could exclude nested dot directories from the build.\r\n\r\nA concrete example: the next version of the Material theme will bundle the FontAwesome files as SVGs for inlining during build time, but MkDocs copies all of them to the `site` directory. The folder structure is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nassets/images/icons/fontawesome/...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current workaround is to add a `*.html` to the files bundles with the theme, resulting in a `*.svg.html` extension for each of the 1.500 icons. While this works, it's semantically incorrect.\r\n\r\nIf MkDocs would ignore nested dot directories, we could just use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nassets/images/icons/.fontawesome/...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by @waylan, the code in question is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/2fca717794c0c2e581b8ba17149bc292edeb83e4/mkdocs/structure/files.py#L67-L69\r\n\r\nI'm not proficient in Python, but since this looks like a glob implementation, I would guess that `**/.*` would solve the problem", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1981/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1981/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1952", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1952/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1952/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1952/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1952", "id": 545287743, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1NDUyODc3NDM=", "number": 1952, "title": "How to add a watched directory", "user": {"login": "pawamoy", "id": 3999221, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTkyMjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3999221?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy", "html_url": "https://github.com/pawamoy", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pawamoy/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 74510486, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3NDUxMDQ4Ng==", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "fc2929", "default": false, "description": null}, {"id": 135233982, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMzUyMzM5ODI=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/labels/Needs%20design%20decision", "name": "Needs design decision", "color": "c7def8", "default": false, "description": null}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2020-01-04T13:55:21Z", "updated_at": "2020-04-19T20:15:31Z", "closed_at": "2020-04-19T20:15:30Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The docs says:\r\n\r\n> The serve event is only called when the serve command is used during development.

However, when we did so, we renamed some files (`css/bootstrap-custom.min.css` => `css/bootstrap.min.css` and `js/bootstrap-3.0.3.min.js` => `js/bootstrap.min.js`). The problem is that other themes inherit from the `mkdocs` theme with the old file names. The renaming in #1597 breaks those themes. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the new names make more sense. On the other hand, we promised forward compatibility with version 1 and there is no easy way (that I'm aware of) to gracefully deprecate the old filenames. We need to resolve this conflict before releasing version 1.1. In other words, this is a blocking issue to releasing version 1.1.\r\n\r\nI see a few possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Revert the filenames. Yes, that means a file named `bootstrap-3.0.3.min.js` would actually contain a different version of Bootstrap, but it would be the easy fix.\"\r\n2. Leave the change in-place and document it for third party themes. In practice, this probably would not be too disruptive as the only themes I'm aware of which make use of inheritance are [mkdocs-bootswatch][1] and [mkdocs-bootstrap][2], both of which are maintained by the MkDocs team.\r\n3. Some other solution I haven't thought of.\r\n\r\nIf we go with option 1, then a PR to this repo would address the issue.

Please help!\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/1758/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0,

postings you mentioned a difference between a path (all with \"\\\\\") and a link (all with \"/\").\r\nIn mkdocs I see now I've mixed them up completely for linking to -for example- local images. This has always worked without any issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a difference in link resolution between:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n[absolute url](/imgs/image.png)\r\n\r\n[absolute path](\\imgs\\image.png)\r\n```\r\nFirst one results in a absolute html link. The second a relative one. \r\nIs is behaviour intentional ? I hope so as it will solve an issue I am having. If not I'd really like to know before building on it while running the risk of this behaviour being changed in the future.\r\n\r\nI hope I am not asking the obvious. I've checked the docs but don't seem to find any mention of this.\r\n\r\nThanks.

I'd like to propose that MkDocs themes and the bootstrap themes switch to loading jquery at the top of the page (or before user content is added) instead of at the bottom.  This matches the behavior of the readthedocs theme.  \n\nThis change would allow users to use jquery within their documents to spice things up, like many of the examples shown here http://bwmarrin.github.io/MkDocsPlus/\n\nPlease also see this related issue here : https://github.com/bwmarrin/MkDocsPlus/issues/2\nI waited a bit to see if the OP for the above issue wanted to push this issue up over here but it looks like he's vanished.

paulproteus paulproteus 36 Jun 17 17:24 .#index.md -> paulproteus@charkha.27783:1434311808\n```\n- These files are Emacs' way of using symlinks to track which computer+process was Emacs-ing the file, so that in case of a crash, Emacs can figure out how to restore its state.\n\nWhat I expect:\n- When I edit `somethingelse.md` and press save, I expect the mkdocs livereload to reload the browser.\n\nWhat I see instead:\n\n```\nINFO    -  Building documentation... \nERROR   -  file not found: /home/paulproteus/projects/sandstorm/docs/.#index.md \nERROR   -  Error building page

If a \"No such file or directory\" error occurs, but the problem is a broken symlink, the `mkdocs` build should continue as if the file does not exist. Note that this arguably is a special-case to handle Emacs' own weirdness; a different way to do it would be to look at the list of git ignored files.\n- Perhaps in general, `mkdocs` should issue a warning (not an error) on broken symlinks, gracefully ignoring them.\n\nI'm open to a bunch of ideas. I wanted to file this in the hopes of sparking a discussion where the maintainers of mkdocs could express their opinion about the best way forward.\n\nThanks so much! Also hi! I'm twitter.com/asheeshlaroia and was chatting with a mkdocs developer earlier today. Seems like a great project!

It seems obvious now that this would wipe out everything including the .git/ for the project (glad this was a test). Possibly, it could recursively check `site_dir` for a .git, warn and exit. Or just a disclaimer [here](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#build-directories) of this possibility would be enough, so no one else tries this and wipes out their project (and maybe you could recommend to new users how to maintain site development and build output in the same repo).\n\nThanks,\nKris\n", "reactions": {"url":

We will soon launch a docs site based on mkdocs.\n<moshe_wo_> one possible bug i am seeing with readthedocs theme is that it does not show subitems in the navigation. i.e. h1/h2 headings. other themes do this well. am using 0.11.1\n<moshe_wo_> looks like this is called the toctree\n<moshe_wo_> for example, i would expect the heading at http://drush.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install/ to also be visible in the left hand nav\n<moshe_wo_> i am seeing this problem locally, not just on readthedocs.org\n<moshe_wo_> ping d0ugal - see above, when you get a chance\n<moshe_wo_> readthedocs certainly supports these subitems - http://arborworkflows.readthedocs.org/en/latest/opentree.html\n<moshe_wo_> it seems to only work when your files are in a subdir of /docs\n<moshe_wo_> thats non-obvious\n<moshe_wo_> but anyway, progress\n<moshe_wo_> thanks for mkdocs\n<kevin-brown> moshe_wo_: So, is the problem solved?\n<moshe_wo_> kevin-brown: it is solved for me, yes. would be nice to document this i think\n<moshe_wo_> its a quirk of readthedocs theme, i think. other themes dont require navigation headers in order to show section links in nav\n<moshe_wo_> bbl\n```\n", "reactions":

toggle icon when the site is viewed on mobile devices with small screens (e.g., iPhone). As the result, the site visitor doesn't have a way to display the TOC. This issue did not exist in version 0.10.0, which properly displayed the TOC toggle icon in the top left corner.\n\nOne way to observe this issue is to view the MkDocs site on readthedocs.org from an iPhone:\n- The latest build, presumably using 0.11 at the moment, exhibits the issue: http://mkdocs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ (first screenshot below)\n- The 0.10 build doesn't exhibit the issue: http://mkdocs.readthedocs.org/en/0.10/ (second screenshot below)\n\nThis issue can be reproduced outside the readthedocs.org site by building a site using MkDocs 0.11.0 and 0.11.1, and comparing the results to the same site built using version 0.10.0.\n\n![latest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3092125/5268286/19d4b256-7a26-11e4-9f40-0201634234bf.png) ![v0

account when changing anchor targets.\n- The dev server mode (mkdocs serve) still ignores the\n  `use_directory_urls` option in order to have user-friendly URLs.\n- There is a new test case for post-processing converted Markdown when\n  `use_directory_urls` is `False`.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/64/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":
