I have 2 BF-109 squadrons in a campaign I am building. While the one that Brucheville gives me no problems, the one at Carpiquet consistently gets converted into an FW-190 Anton squadron UNLESS I add a second premade BF-109 squadron yaml, at which point it will work. However, if I only have a single premade BF-109 squadron, the BF-109 squadron at Carpiquet always gets generated as a FW-190 squadron.\r\n\r\nThis might potentially be related to the \"u\" with umlaut in the BF-109's name, which has caused it to be referred to in different ways in different files. It is possible that this is an unrelated problem however, but I am mentioning it here as a potential cause. I suspect the lone premade squadron always gets assigned to Brucheville as it has a lower ID number (5 vs 19)\r\n\r\nExamples of differing names:\r\nSquadron yaml for Jagdgeschwader 53: \"Bf 109 K-4 Kurf\u00fcrst\"\r\nIn the Bf-109K-4.yaml under resources\\units\\aircraft\\\" \"Bf 109 K-4 Kurf\\xFCrst\"\r\nIn the yaml for Khopa's Caen to Evreux campaign: \"Bf 109 K-4 Kurf\\u00fcrst\"\r\n\r\nI have tried all three variants, but none of them allowed me to create a randomly generated BF-109 squadron at Carpiquet.\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[final_countdown_2.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/11239171/final_countdown_2.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2786/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2786/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2785", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2785/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2785/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2785/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2785", "id": 1669304173, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5jf49t", "number": 2785, "title": "WW2 fighters with premade squadrons have a smaller default mission set than randomly generated squadrons", "user": {"login": "Starfire13", "id": 72491792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDkxNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72491792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starfire13", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 17, "created_at": "2023-04-15T10:41:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-18T18:35:43Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-18T18:35:42Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Build information\n\nDCS Liberation 7.0.0\r\nBuild 4777\r\nGit revision 8150176fc62d7ead6faab45a615e522b5afd87fd\n\n### Description\n\nWW2 fighters with premade squadrons are restricted to the following mission types in their squadron YAML.\r\n  - CAS\r\n  - Escort\r\n  - Intercept\r\n  - OCA/Aircraft\r\n  - Fighter sweep\r\n  - BARCAP\r\n  - TARCAP\r\n\r\nHowever, randomly generated squadrons have a larger set of mission types available as by default they can also perform\r\n  - Strike\r\n  - DEAD\r\n  - BAI\r\n  - OCA/Runway\r\n\r\nAs an example of this problem, here is a campaign with 2 Dora-9 squadrons.

Upon careful inspection, the aircraft are actually spawned in air in a \"turning point\" waypoint type. this causes them to crash immediately at mission start.\r\nA symptom that can also happen is that the aircraft are spawned above the runway in a single point. causing all of them to spawn and combust.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that in syria, falklands, persian gulf and nevada there are \"Heli parking slots\". planes spawned there automatically turn into turning point and thus the issue is created.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the fix should be in pydcs or somewhere else, but this causes the enemy AI to always die above a certain aircraft count in aleppo.\r\n\r\nCould also be fixed by regarding the `airplanes` parameter in the parking slot object.\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[liberation_nextturn_miz.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/11200943/liberation_nextturn_miz.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2782/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2782/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2781", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2781/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2781/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2781/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2781", "id": 1660316504, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5i9mtY", "number": 2781, "title": "F-14 and F/A-18 flights carrying TALDs will overfly target site and die", "user": {"login": "Starfire13", "id": 72491792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDkxNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72491792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starfire13", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}, {"id": 3448592476, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCJZWrc7NjVhc", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/needs-changelog", "name": "needs-changelog", "color": "8AE014", "default": false, "description": "For PRs/bugs that were merged without being added to the changelog."}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2023-04-10T06:32:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-27T02:30:55Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-27T02:30:36Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Build information\n\nDCS Liberation 7.0.0\r\nBuild 4775\r\nGit revision 5c72e0754a438af1ea1cb1643528da7ce1df4b42\n\n### Description\n\nF-14 and F/A-18 flights carrying TALDs will not RTB after releasing their TALDs but instead overfly their target and most likely get shot down.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because they are relying on the waypoint command \"RTB on out of ammo= .ASM\" to turn around, but now that TALDs have been moved into their own category (Decoy), this flag does not get tripped when TALDs are depleted. Hornets carrying HARMs work just fine, so this is specifically a TALD problem.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this, I have setup a mission with three flights. One (named HARM) is just a standard SEAD flight with HARMS, to demonstrate that they are indeed RTBing after launching their HARMs as expected.\r\n\r\nThe second flight (named TALD) is one carrying TALDs. I have modified the weapon release type to Decoy so they will actually drop their TALDs (modified .miz attached below). This flight will not RTB after dropping its TALDs, continuing on to overfly the target.\r\n\r\nThe third flight (named NOA2A) is a flight modified to carry no A2A missiles, weapon release type changed to Decoy, and with \"RTB on out of ammo= .ASM\" changed to \"RTB on out of ammo= all\" (because it will not trigger if set to .ASM since TALDs are now in their own category, I tested this to make sure). This flight will launch its TALDs and RTB.\r\n\r\nI have also tried setting  \"RTB on out of ammo\" to \"guided\", \"bombs\", and \"guided bombs\", none of which worked with TALDs. Unfortunately, ED did not create a  \"RTB on out of ammo= decoy\" option when splitting TALDs into their own category.\n\n### Save game and other files\n\nHere is the Liberation save in case you want to make your own modifications for testing. Note that without the changes in the mission editor described above, this save will not replicate the problem and workarounds.

The Hornet has HARMs, so you can't just set weapon release type to Decoy, meaning Hornet either needs its own mission type for TALDs, or the weapon release type needs to be set based on loadout (e.g. if it's set on Liberation SEAD and carrying HARMs, use the standard Auto release type, and it's set on Liberation CEAD and carrying TALDs, use the Decoy release type).\n\n### Save game and other files\n\nNote that if you want to use this save for testing, you will have to manually change the weapon release type for the DECOY and DECOYF14 flights to Decoy.\r\n[TALD Test 3.liberation.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/11187946/TALD.Test.3.liberation.zip)\r\n\r\nI have already manually edited it in this .miz file:\r\n[liberation_nextturn.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/11187962/liberation_nextturn.zip)\r\n\r\nThere are four flights in total, 2 Hornet and 2 Tomcat flights. 2 are unedited (they will not launch TALDs) and 2 are edited (these will launch TALDs).", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2780/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2780/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2779", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2779/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2779/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2779/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2779", "id": 1660183826, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5i9GUS", "number": 2779, "title": "Weapon release type does not update when SEAD flight is recreated as DEAD", "user": {"login": "Starfire13", "id": 72491792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDkxNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72491792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starfire13", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}, {"id": 3448592476, "node_id": "LA_kwDOCJZWrc7NjVhc", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/needs-changelog", "name": "needs-changelog", "color": "8AE014", "default": false, "description": "For PRs/bugs that were merged without being added to the changelog."}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-10T03:42:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-22T17:54:55Z", "closed_at": "2023-04-22T17:54:44Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Build information\n\nDCS Liberation 7.0.0\r\nBuild 4775\r\nGit revision 5c72e0754a438af1ea1cb1643528da7ce1df4b42\n\n### Description\n\nWhen you plan a SEAD flight, weapon release type is set as guided (you can see this under the ingress waypoint in the mission editor).

There are two scenarios where this happens:\r\n\r\n1. Factions using any coalition other than \"Third Reich\" or \"Combined Joint Task Forces Red\" do not have access to the Kdo unit, thus user is unable to manually add it to the group.\r\n2. Factions using the \"Combined Joint Task Forces Red\" are still not generating Kdo with flak groups.

The Built-in DCS Capture event seems to check only for ground units in the are and recognized the capture event. As we removed that built in function there were some issue reports on the Discord that the capture is not working any more (with only the custom trigger zone we already use for FOBs).\r\nThere was also an report from Snappy that a flipped Helo prevent the capture of an FOB.\r\n\r\nWhat should be changed to prevent this:\r\n- Check if the custom trigger zone can be adopted to only check for ground units / objects \r\n- Try to find out what dcs uses built in and reuse that as custom trigger zone\r\n\r\nThe current hotfix #2652 onyl re-adds the built-in dcs event to Airfields. So we currently have 2 checks for airfields but still the same issue for FOBs as we dont have the built-in function there.\n\n### Save game and other

information\n\n- DCS version 2.8\r\n- Liberation version 5.2\r\n- Liberation campaign Northern Russia\r\n- ground crew doesn\u00b4t respond if asked to turn on the ground power/connect air supply\n\n### Description\n\nHi guys,\r\n\r\nI came across a bug with F-14B playing the Northern Russia campaign. \r\n\r\nI was assign to take off from the Tbilisi-Lochni airport and begin the mission in a cold/dark F14B on the parking lot. I found out, that I can\u00b4t contact the ground crew and ask them to turn on the ground power and connect the air supply. I get no response from the crew, even if I\u00b4m a doing everything correctly and can hear my \"pilot\" asking them to connect the power/air. This happened after I updated to the DCS v. 2.8 (I generated the Liberation mission after the update, its not an old mission), it did work from the same airfield in the past missions before the update.\r\n\r\nFirst I thought I\u00b4m having some issues with the Vaicom Pro, which broke after the DCS update, but after the community patch I can use Vaicom Pro now. I found out, that even asking for ground power/ air supply via comm menu doesn\u00b4t work, so its definitely something else causing the trouble. \r\n\r\nI tested my own missions made in mission editor and DCS training missions, but this bug doesn\u00b4t occur with them and ground crew responds correctly. I tried to run a new DCS Liberation campaign and mission from new campaign worked properly as well. \r\n\r\nSo something is bugged with that particular \"old\" Liberation generated mission. Please give it a try and take a look into it someday. I enclose the liberation miz file and saved game.\r\n\r\nThx,\r\n\r\nGoliathus\n\n### Save game and other

build\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nHey guys,\r\n\r\nI was running the Syria - Operation Peace Spring campaign recently and I came across a possible minor bug.\r\n\r\nAfter I captured the Damascus airbase I departed from this airport with my F/A-18C and I found out that I can\u00b4t reach the ATC via CH1 preset freqency on COMM2. This is because the mission generator generates wrong frequency 251.850 MHz (on the kneeboard as well), but the Damascus ATC is listening on frequency 252.650 MHz.\r\n\r\nI\u00b4m not sure how the DCS Liberation mission generator works, I\u00b4m just a simple user of this great dynamic campaign generator, but I guess that the freq. of the Damascus ATC was different somewhere in the past, but now it should be updated to 252.650 MHz in the DCS Liberation files, so it could be generated correctly. Of course,  it is easy to overcome this \"issue\" by changing the preset frequency manually...\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at this issue somewhere in the future. I enclose screenshots of my kneeboard with wrong ATC frequency (as I said, I departed from the Damascus airport), screenshot from the mission editor, where there is stated wrong ATC frequency, and a picture of the F10 map with correct ATC frequency.\r\n\r\nThx,\r\n\r\nGoliathus\r\n![Kneeboard Damascus Freq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84329357/188567513-9c1c4626-bd55-4a4c-adb2-ac0362d02da3.jpg)\r\n![Mission editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84329357/188567516-bad5657c-5b1f-46a9-8531-2bbd5925bd58.jpg)\r\n![Damascus Freq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84329357/188567519-5f8d00b1-5d21-46a8-bcf6-bc84d1c4bd70.jpg)\r\n\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[Liberation files.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/9494153/Liberation.files.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2416/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2416/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2405", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2405/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2405/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2405/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2405", "id": 1360733004, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5RGyNM", "number": 2405, "title": "Carrier killed in state.json but not being removed from game", "user": {"login": "Bigs2013", "id": 112048037, "node_id": "U_kgDOBq23pQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112048037?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013", "html_url": "https://github.com/Bigs2013", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bigs2013/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2022-09-03T02:46:47Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-23T11:57:45Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-23T11:57:45Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Development build\n\n4211\n\n### Description\n\nCarrier refuses to die.

where flights of non-flyable aircraft can be given player slots. Doing so prevents mission generation. With the release of the Mirage F1 and its multiple variants (only one of which is currently flyable), I think this might be a good time to tackle the bug. Otherwise, we are going to get a bunch of folks asking why they can't fly their Mirage F1 (because they've given a player slot to a non-flyable variant).\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[Non-flyable Aircraft with Player Slots Example #4151.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/9173576/Non-flyable.Aircraft.with.Player.Slots.Example.4151.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2339/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2339/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2338", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2338/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2338/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2338/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2338", "id": 1315605414, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5Oaoum", "number": 2338, "title": "6.0 preview 4142 - widget error message", "user": {"login": "holyorangejuice", "id": 4298744, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg3NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4298744?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice", "html_url": "https://github.com/holyorangejuice", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-07-23T08:46:03Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-25T21:03:42Z", "closed_at": "2022-11-25T21:03:41Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Development build\n\n6.0 preview 4142\n\n### Description\n\nAll worked well and I observed a pop up error after accepting results of the first turn.

After the mission we saw that over 200 map objects were declared dead by liberation.\r\n\r\nFurther review showed that every single map object that I converted into an objective building was marked dead. Any normal liberation objective buildings that are built off the Tech Combine placement were fine. \r\n\r\nAttached is the save prior to launching the mission, the miz file generated by that save, the json that made the objects dead and the tacview file. I can't explain how this happened. \r\n\r\nThe latest DCS open beta update was used as well.\r\n[BUG.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8725357/BUG.zip)\r\n \n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[BUG.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8725363/BUG.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2222/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2222/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "not_planned"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2212", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2212/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2212/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2212/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2212", "id": 1232121558, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5JcK7W", "number": 2212, "title": "Aircraft in the air start too low", "user": {"login": "holyorangejuice", "id": 4298744, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg3NDQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4298744?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice", "html_url": "https://github.com/holyorangejuice", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/holyorangejuice/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 20, "created_at": "2022-05-11T07:15:35Z", "updated_at": "2022-07-06T18:56:40Z", "closed_at": "2022-07-06T18:56:39Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Development build\n\nhttps://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/actions/runs/2286928013\n\n### Description\n\nWe ran on build 3841 for five hours tonight and three of those mission the F15c barcap, starting in air due to start at first contact, were at so low altitude majority of them crashed.

It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is armed with a 30 mm (1.18 in) M230 chain gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage, and four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons for carrying armament and stores, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods.

The campaign will generate.\r\n8. Cheat capture Sukhumi-Babushara\r\n9. Attempt to buy AAA for one of the air defence sites at Sukhumi.\r\n10.

This might lead users to think that nothing happened or inadvertently cause more than one click, spending more money than intended.\r\n\r\nI'm also fairly sure it closed on initial purchase before the rework patch.\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[3627 check.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8237708/3627.check.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2071/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2071/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2070", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2070/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2070/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2070/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2070", "id": 1167295045, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5Fk4JF", "number": 2070, "title": "TGO SAM replacement doesn't update on map", "user": {"login": "Hornet2041", "id": 55866858, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODY2ODU4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55866858?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041", "html_url": "https://github.com/Hornet2041", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}, {"id": 2589275526, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyNTg5Mjc1NTI2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/UX", "name": "UX", "color": "d78df4", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-03-12T13:52:21Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-12T19:23:54Z", "closed_at": "2022-03-12T19:23:54Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\r\n\r\nDevelopment build\r\n\r\n### Development build\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/actions/runs/1972037759\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55866858/158020636-24ac299e-1f7c-4803-b74d-cbe988489de4.png)\r\n\r\nReplaced the SAM unit at PORPOISE with an SA-10 (instead of SA-13).

Causing front line units to move to adjacent FOBs to the new front lines created. This pulls units from the most forward front line. Expected behavior is to have no base capture events well behind the front line with no enemies to capture it. To reproduce the error, click next turn. It appears to happen at random but a number of bases will go red, regardless of units on the base. All FOBs contain FARPs for helicopters.

I remember perfectly that in the older versions after 2 or 3 turns with the massive destruction of enemy ground units i had the control of an enemy base. Actually in the campaign Multipart Russia i completely destroyed all units in Sochi-Adler airbase but the frontline it's in the same position. I remember that in the same situation in the older version (3-4 versions before) i had the complete control of the airbase.\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n[liberation_nextturn.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8028206/liberation_nextturn.zip)\r\n[caucas3.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8028207/caucas3.zip)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2004/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2004/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2000", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2000/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2000/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2000/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/2000", "id": 1125195840, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5DESBA", "number": 2000, "title": "Error Pop-up", "user": {"login": "Eagle01ph", "id": 84751885, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzUxODg1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84751885?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph", "html_url": "https://github.com/Eagle01ph", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Eagle01ph/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-02-06T12:54:13Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-06T21:07:52Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-06T17:59:48Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\nDevelopment build\n\n### Development build\n\nhttps://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/actions/runs/1797094266\n\n### Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nOn the v6.0.0-3368 preview build.  \r\n\r\nAfter creating a new WW2 campaing with a faction that has the Mosquito included as a flyable aircraft.

release\r\n\r\n### Development build\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/actions/runs/1765437916\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis bug was previously reported by sncollie (https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1636), but I was not able to reproduce it at the time and the bug report was closed. Turns out, the bug occurs on Pass Turn only, not on Take Off. It is consistently replicable on clicking Pass Turn.\r\n\r\nSet up an A-10C II squadron and decide to add DEAD to the selected mission types for that squadron. On turn 1 (after purchasing A-10s), you will find that they cannot actually be tasked for DEAD. Opening up the squadron's window in Air Wing will show DEAD is unticked. If you then tick the checkbox, you'll find that A-10s still cannot be tasked for DEAD. If you then hit Pass Turn, you'll encounter this error.\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72491792/152534128-1d712b2b-df3f-4792-b6e0-63b3bf0192bf.JPG)\r\n\r\nUnticking the DEAD checkbox will prevent the error from occuring again. This error does not appear to trigger for every single extra mission type on every aircraft. For example, adding BARCAP/TARCAP to the F-15E works without errors (but adding DEAD causes an error). Adding TARCAP/BARCAP/DEAD to the A-10C will generate an error.\r\n\r\nObviously no one would (or should) be crazy enough to use A-10s for BARCAP, but I think either the option should be disabled or it should be allowed without triggering an error.\r\n\r\n### Save game and other files\r\n\r\nSample save attached. DEAD checkbox already ticked. Hit pass turn to trigger error.\r\n\r\n[Error after adding mission type.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/8003217/Error.after.adding.mission.type.zip)", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1995/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1995/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1992", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1992/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1992/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1992/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1992", "id": 1121713367, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc5C2_zX", "number": 1992, "title": "F/A-18C have inverted radio usage (possibly)", "user": {"login": "Robune", "id": 98878469, "node_id": "U_kgDOBeTEBQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98878469?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune", "html_url": "https://github.com/Robune", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Robune/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-02-02T09:51:38Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-02T10:24:53Z", "closed_at": "2022-02-02T10:24:52Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Affected versions\n\n5.1.0\n\n### Development build\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\nDCS Liberation assigns ATC & primary tactical frequencies (AWACS, etc...) on F/A-18C's Radio 2 (COMM 2), and intra-flight frequencies on Radio 1 (COMM 1).

Setup the transfer with 9 aircraft, then buy 1 additional aircraft for the squadron afterwards. All 10 will be transferred.\r\n\r\n2. Alternatively, buy another aircraft for a squadron already at the destination airfield.\r\n\r\nEssentially, that parking spot is only unavailable when setting up the transfer.\r\n\r\n### Save game and other files\r\n\r\nHere's a save file created using Operation Vectron's Claw on 5.1 release.

That waypoint is 100+ km away from waypoint 4 or in other words, away from Area of Operation, what explains why most of the aircrafts fly blindly to their death. I changed that distance to 3 times bigger and redid the mission, suddenly all the blue fighters actually attacked the enemy. It really looks cool on the TacView.\r\nI really like what you did with Liberation, it's awesome and I will gladly support you guys, but can you please set this as a priority bug and fix it since all you must do is to multiply the 'max_engage_distance' by 3 and problem solved (but another introduced).\r\nI would suggest (you don't have to listen to me ofc, it's all up to you) to make a check how far is the closest SAM area from the waypoint where you created this \"Start Enroute Task\" and maybe use that as a condition for max distance. It would be the best to give us, the players|users, the capability to change this distance via the UI (while also multiplying your momentarily default distance by 3 to create a new default).\r\nPlease. This Liberation is really cool and brings a joy to my heart. Thanks for all the hard work! :)\n\n### Save game and other files\n\n-", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1916/reactions", "total_count": 0,

Should be J11. Next select another aircraft in the flight list and select on another Red AI aircraft. The aircraft will now show that it is what ever you have selected earlier. \r\nexample: I selected my hornet in the ME and then selected Aa Red AI aircraft to see it was a hornet. Selected another aircraft like. A10 and the same Red AI aircraft is now indicating an A10.

At the moment by a Caucasus campaign Russia (AI) decided to spend all his money by L-39 Albatros which does simply nothing compared to all other possible aircrafts in its inventory.\r\nI.e. in Mozdok, they have 27 L-39, 2 Su-25 and 2 Su-33 which made the A/A missions a slaughter house...\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nHard to say how to reproduce as it is not simply click click issue but more a campaign time frame issue\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAI might be enhanced so that it can recognize what causes the most of the trouble for him. i.e. if the player airforces is dominating, AI should invest on reparing SAMs, buying air superioty aircrafts.

That leaves this campaign inaccessible to most players.\r\n2) AV-8B cannot fill the capability hole (in particular, SEAD) left by the F18. Especially not in AI hands.\r\n\r\nThe F-18 is far more common than F-14, and far more necessary for the threat environment created in this campaign.\r\nThe harrier, as available on the LHA, cannot quite fill the hole the missing f18 leaves.\r\n\r\n**Workarounds:**\r\n-Currently, it may require a custom faction that doesn't have tomcats.\r\n-#1758, when released.\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\nThe 'easy' solution is for the above to be fixed in the campaign yaml quoted above, to prefer specific airframes.\r\nThe mount Barrigada campaign has a similar problem, missing both F18 and F16, and also using the older model A-10C.\r\nAnd that's just the ones I've seen so far.\r\n\r\nThe 'hard' solution would be for a squadron to not only have a role (e.g. CAS) but each role having a 'strength' (/suitability) value for how well suited the aircraft is for that role.  The F-14 would be stronger for BARCAP/air-to-air, but the F-18 would be stronger for CAS.

Create a liberation campaign in the Syrian theatre\r\n2. Create a AEW&C package originating from **Tha'lah** airbase and export the mission to DCS\r\n3. In the mission editor, in the trigger section, go to the trigger called 'Set DCS Liberation data'\r\n4. Note here how the section **-- list the AWACs generated by Liberation** contains the created AEW&C package called something similar to ```{dcsGroupName='Tha'lah AEW&C|81|42|7|A-50|', callsign='Overlord', radio='253.0' }```\r\n5. Launch the mission\r\n\r\n## Expected Behaviour\r\nUpon launching the mission, expect to receive the error ```SCRIPTING: Mission script error: [string \"...\"]:24: '}' expected near 'lah'```. Several modules and LUA plugin will not work if you continue the mission.\r\nThis error makes sense as the line in point 4 of the section above, contains an unclosed string.\r\nIf I manually correct the error by changing ```'Tha'lah``` into ```'Thalah``` the error message will not appear.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\nAs the mechanics of the issue are more obvious than other more complex bugs, I skip providing any saves files for now. But if this seems helpful to resolve the issue I will add them later.\r\n- **DCS Liberation [5.0.0]**\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

I was told on the discord it sets the latest a flight could take off. Setting this to the lowest setting should, in theory, get more red flights in the air, in a shorter period of time. Based on the blue auto tasking it seems setting this to 30, makes the latest TOT around 1 hour long. \r\n\r\nThe bug I'm experiencing is changing this slider mid campaign. It seems to break the tasking. My blue flights are auto tasked but I don't have any red air doing tasks.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n-I set my current campaign from 60 minutes to 30 minutes\r\n-Launch game and fast forward at 3x for almost 1 hour in game time.\r\n-No enemy air as confirmed by two tacview files\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI loaded a brand new campaign and set the slider before hitting begin campaign.

Start new campaign\r\n2. Enable supercarrier, 3x income multiplier and 5000 cred on blue.\r\n3. Automate runway repairs, fron-line purchases, and aircraft purchases.\r\n4. Finish the setup and begin campaign.\r\n5. Insert player in the upper right dead/sead mission\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSome of the times this will create autogenerated frequencies outside the range of the Vipers COM 2 (108.000 to 115.975 MHz).\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nThis happened 4 out of 5 times for me. I suspect it's because I am cheating with the income and the generator creates too many flights to separate the frequencies.\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are located in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n- The state.json file from the finished mission when the problem is related to results processing. By default these are located in your Liberation install directory.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation [e.g. 2.3.1]: v5.0.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem

Purchase lots of aircraft at `Ramat David`, specifically lots of multirole, some awacs and tankers\r\n3. Generate campaign\r\n4.

In prior versions this can cause UI lag, but in 6.0 this can actually cause a crash because the UI may be updating in another thread which can cause a `FlightJs` to be GC'd while the js side is still using it. I'm reasonably certain of that diagnosis because if I disable the signals for package/flight selection change then I can rapidly change packages with the sim running without any crashes, but with them connected it crashes fairly easily.\r\n\r\nLocking would be tricky because we would need to expose a lock/unlock API to js, but we can avoid the problem _and_ improve performance by instead notifying the model of a change in selected status instead of rebuilding the whole flight list when the package or flight changes.", "reactions": {"url":

already been reported.\r\n\r\nIf reporting a DCS AI bug, check https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation#dcs-bugs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWe've been running a Cyprus liberation for a while, we're on turn 6ish. It's been fine for the past month or so, but when I loaded it up today I am unable to take-off. Two key things I've noticed:\r\n\r\n1. Pressing 'take-off' either does nothing or crashes the lib client.\r\n2. The cmd window has a long list of 'no data' errors (screenshot attached)\r\n\r\nI've checked my DCS folder location and everything is pointed to the right place. Apart from updating DCS itself, nothing has changed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Load up the attached campaign.\r\n2. Check cmd window for missing unit warnings.\r\n3. Click 'take-off'.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nThe following items are attached in the zip file: [sabrecyprus.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/7488056/sabrecyprus.zip)\r\n- sabrecyprus.liberation (the campaign file)\r\n- liberation.log (the full logfile in the lib folder)\r\n- liberation_nextturn.miz (the last mission we ran)\r\n- current_state.json (the state.json from my lib folder)\r\n- previous_state.json (the state.json from the ser\r\nver we ran the last mission on)\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation [e.g. 2.3.1]: 4.1.1\r\n - DCS Version: 2.7.7.15038\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone.",

Since OCA/Runway cannot be performed with guided munitions (AI will not use them against runways), OCA/Runway mission type ought to be removed from the defaults for these aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - #2976", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1703/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1703/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1702", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1702/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1702/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1702/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1702", "id": 1040103713, "node_id": "I_kwDOCJZWrc49_rkh", "number": 1702, "title": "No attack orders given to anti-ship flights when enemy carrier is the target", "user": {"login": "Starfire13", "id": 72491792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDkxNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72491792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starfire13", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-10-30T09:54:20Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-06T23:35:56Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-06T23:35:56Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nMikef brought this to our attention on Discord and I did some testing to verify. There don't appear to be any orders on the ingress waypoint (or any other waypoint for that matter) directing an anti-ship flight to attack their intended target (edit: only applies when target is a carrier). They fly to the ingress waypoint and then RTB. This applies to both Hornets and Vikings, and the bug exists in both the latest dev build #2976 and 4.1.1.

From a cold start aircraft, the view slews uncontrollably in-cockpit and the aircraft itself rubber-bands all over the place.  Initial testing showed the P-51 working fine, but now the P-51 is affected as well.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a multiplayer Liberation mission with F-86 client slots using DCS 2.7.6.\r\n2. Select an F-86 client slot and spawn in.\r\n3. Issue manifests immediately.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nPlayer should spawn into the aircraft with full control as normal.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are located in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n- The state.json file from the finished mission when the problem is related to results processing.

mission editor.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the kneeboards show the correct intra flight frequencies, so another way to reformulate the bug is: most players' COMM1 channel1 frequencies are not correct: they don't match the frequencies found in the kneeboards.\r\n\r\n(Please also note that all COMM2 frequencies, ie COMM2 channel 1/2/3/4 are all correct, as per the mission editor and the kneeboards)\r\n\r\nExample: I am starting this campaign:\r\n\r\n![Capture d\u2019\u00e9cran

WOMBAT\r\n- BARCAP Truman\r\n\r\nI press the START button and then load the generated liberation_nextturn.miz in the mission editor. In the mission editor I check the various intra flight frequencies. It says:\r\n\r\n- SEAD RAVEN: 118 Mhz\r\n- strike MONKEY: 123 Mhz\r\n- strike WOMBAT: 119 Mhz\r\n- BARCAP Truman: 120 Mhz\r\n\r\nI close the mission editor, launch a hosted server in the DCS multiplayer panel, load liberation_nextturn.miz, choose one of the players' slots and press FLY. Once in the plane (they are all F18s), I start the right engine so that I can check the COMM1 channel1 frequency.

AI may spend a full load on a single unit, ie. BTR killed with 4 mavericks, 4 JDAMs/GBUs, leaving other units in the target location unharmed.\r\n2 - AI attacking targets not visible, or missing its target but would have hit if the targets didn't move.  Are targets for the AI generated by coordinates, rather than the actual unit?\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nThe bug seems to be in two parts\r\n\r\n1: (Waste of munitions) \r\nLoading up an AI-aircraft with AG-weapons tasked with SEAD/DEAD or Strike mission, the AI engages the same target with multiple individual weapons of the same type, wasting the loadout and will only be able to kill a single target. \r\n\r\nIn the attached tacview file, a group of 4 Harriers are tasked with engaging a group of 8 T80Us (Target location Fennec). Each Harrier engages one single tank with all of its munitions (4 mavericks). The rest of the tanks are unengaged, meaning the attack is very uneffective.\r\n\r\n2: (Coordinates, rather than units?) \r\nIn the attached tacview file the same group of 8 T80Us are attacked by a total of 16 AGM65Fs launched from Harriers (Target location Fennec). The first maverick hit and kills its target. The other tanks are spooked and starts to move immediately for a couple of meters. The rest of the mavericks impact the ground where the rest of the targets initially stood. Are targets generated on the basis of coordinates, rather than actual units?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nMake the AI engage a location with multiple targets. Load the aircraft with several weapons of the same kind, ie. several AGM65Fs, or several GBU38 JDAM\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n1: I would expect the AI to engage a single target with the necessary amount of munitions, or do several passes to kill the target, not use all its munitions in one run on the same, single unit.\r\n\r\n2: I would expect Fire-and-forget weapons, or weapons that needs to be directed to the target (ie. weapons directed by laser-targeting) to hit its target. Instead the weapons seems to be locked at a location, rather than a individual unit.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation

after planning the next round of action - I press the \"Take Off\" button.   Screenshot of error in console is attached (Liberation_Error.jpg).  It appears that deleting an offending \"transfer of 1 unit\" -  alleviates the issue; once that transfer is cancelled and I press \"Take Off\" the liberation_nextturn.miz mission is generated and I can seemingly proceed.  (see Liberation_Error_Transfer_UI.jpg screenshot; I've included the subsequent now working liberation_nextturn.miz file)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

(UI stays at \"0\")\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected the counter to show me a negative amount. -1, -2, -3 and so on.\r\nIt works like before if you buy planes, but not if you sell them.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are located in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n- The state.json file from the finished mission when the problem is related to results processing. By default these are located in your Liberation install directory.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88510768/129107785-28214f07-b717-4f15-a151-d37b0a3eba93.png)\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation v. 4.1.1\r\n[Danica - Cauc MOD Testing - Turn 04a.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6971593/Danica.-.Cauc.MOD.Testing.-.Turn.04a.zip)\r\n\r\n(In the screenshot I have 3 x Warthog in stock. I've pressed the Sell key 3 times without getting any change in the number. At the 4th press I got the error that I had no more to sell. So the logic is counting down.

By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn).

Set up a flight with either a-a or a-g loadout\r\n2. observe the error in the mission\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor the correct loadout to be there\r\n\r\nSAVEFILE: \r\nhttps://www.filemail.com/d/uqpoqnmvzjwnqlo\r\nfile link only lasts for 1 week, if requested I can send it again\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation  4.0.0\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1463/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1463/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1462", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1462/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1462/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1462/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1462", "id": 952391006, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5NTIzOTEwMDY=", "number": 1462, "title": "units listed as available but they are not", "user": {"login": "Tinchus2009", "id": 14299602, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjk5NjAy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14299602?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009", "html_url": "https://github.com/Tinchus2009", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Tinchus2009/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}, {"id": 2903106072, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyOTAzMTA2MDcy", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/not%20reproducible", "name": "not reproducible", "color": "bfdadc", "default": false, "description": "Closed because the developers cannot reproduce the issue to investigate.

Settings > Campaign Management > Automatic package planning behavior, packages are auto generated.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create New Campaign\r\n2. Go to \"Settings > Campaign Management > Automatic package planning\", and select \"Disabled\".\r\n3. Purchase some aircraft.\r\n4. Click on \"Begin Campaign\"\r\n5. See auto generated packages/missions.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo packages should be generated for player side by AI.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are located in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n- The state.json file from the finished mission when the problem is related to results processing. By default these are located in your Liberation install directory.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- This behavior is seen in Build #2424\r\n",

Obv. the campaign has no way of knowing this, so the AI will base fixed wing aircraft there, which are unable to take off.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create an Operation Atilla Campaign (tested with default factions, reduced money/income)\r\n2. Start the campaign, and check the intel for Lakatamia to make sure fixed wing aircraft have been based there.\r\n3. Launch the mission in DCS.\r\n4. See the AI attempt to take off from Lakatamia - usually resulting in the first aircraft crashing, and subsequent aircraft sitting there.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCampaign shouldn't base fixed wing aircraft out of Lakatamia, although i'm aware this is probably currently a limitation in Liberation or DCS - might have to just remove it from places you can base aircraft?\r\n\r\n**Additional

https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation#dcs-bugs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to '...'\r\n2. Click on '....'\r\n3. Scroll down to '....'\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn).

generate an error windows (see file) when launching the player flight in DCS ME nearly at the end of first launching window. Curiously it does not prevent taking off and flying the bird but with unpredictable events like loss of engine power\r\nThis behavior is not existing with Persian gulf map that run fine\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior\r\n1. Create whatever campaign on Syrian theater for example road to Dubai \r\n2. Pass first turn to populate map\r\n3. S\u00e9lect \u00e0 FA18 and click as player\r\n4. Go to DCs ME\r\n5.  Open lib\u00e9ration next turn\r\n6. Fly mission\r\n7. Get the window error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nGoing to startup without generating error window\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nDoes not produce error if campaign is on Persian gulf \r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\nLib\u00e9ration v3.0\r\nDCS last update\r\nBird FA18 hornet\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are located in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n- The state.json file from the finished mission when the problem is related to results processing. By default these are located in your Liberation install directory.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation [e.g. 2.3.1]: 3.0\r\n![214CF3E5-B1C1-46A1-97E0-B56674EAF9F4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78730674/123331625-cfbf2a80-d53f-11eb-8619-8e53f6f457e2.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any

factories, they are not registered as destroyed in the liberation app.\r\nThis does not apply to liberation-placed objectives (oil rigs etc) which are still destroyed just fine.\r\n\r\nProbable cause is the updated syria map, adding cyprus, changing the IDs of all map baked objects.\r\n\r\nFixing this will likely break dcs stable until it is updated, comparable factions including the new hind.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Load liberation, 3.0, develop_3.x, develop. (develop-4.x untested, presumably still a problem)\r\n2. Create new campaign using syria full map\r\n3. Plot mission to strike factories, for example the three buildings just south of bassel al-assad, or the NDB beacon tower north of it.\r\n4. Using current OB with the changed syria map\r\n5. Destroy the target, finish the mission\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUpon entering the planning stage for the next turn, the destroyed factories should be removed from the map.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation [e.g. 2.3.1]:\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOther syria campaigns should probably also be checked.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1308/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

Even at the default budget, you can see that Liwa AB will fill up and there will be leftover budget.\r\n\r\nI believe this might also be the contributing factor to #1259 as the AWACS are probably at the bottom of the purchasing priority list so there isn't enough space at Liwa for the AI to purchase it. This could also be related to #1258?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIllustrative save attached here:\r\n\r\n[Build 1971 AI Purchaser Bug.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6678558/Build.1971.AI.Purchaser.Bug.zip)\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1260/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1260/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1259", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1259/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1259/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1259/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1259", "id": 925087614, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5MjUwODc2MTQ=", "number": 1259, "title": "[Build 1971] Blue AI Purchaser not Purchasing AEW&C Aircraft in Battle for UAE", "user": {"login": "Mustang-25", "id": 72566076, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTY2MDc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72566076?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mustang-25", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2021-06-18T17:30:16Z", "updated_at": "2021-06-19T18:28:14Z", "closed_at": "2021-06-19T18:28:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "The Blue auto purchaser is not buying any AEW&C aircraft in this campaign.

issue has already been reported.\r\n\r\nIf reporting a DCS AI bug, check https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation#dcs-bugs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nThe EWR ground objects don't show up in the waypoint dropdown list to add them to an existing flight. Like you can still click em and add flight, but can't add them to a flight if the flight was created for a different target - like you set a SEAD flight for some SAM location, but on the way, you wanna hit that EWR you'd have to start with EWR object, then add the SAM to that flight.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nCreate a flight for anything on the map, for fun an OCA. If you have an 'other ground object' like an EWR you wanna also hit, figure out its code name (?), and try to find it in the list where you edit your waypoints and add new waypoint - simply it won't be in the list. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\nThe EWR ground object should show up in the list with the ability to add the target to the flight.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n\r\n[01 - USA 2005 vs Russia 2010 - Inversed - Cacassus Full.zip](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6674720/01.-.USA.2005.vs.Russia.2010.-.Inversed.-.Cacassus.Full.zip)\r\n\r\nThere's an EWR site to the east of Krasnodar-Center, its animal name is [CHICKEN]. I think it only is happening to these EWR sites as the [HAWK] ammo things show up in the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation

\"invert map\" option in order to play as Germans will fail with the \"Incompatible Save game\" message, despite no save game existing.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start new Normandy campaign, check invert map, select e.g. summer 1944 period\r\n2. Select player faction = Germany 1944 and Enemy faction = Allies 1944\r\n3. Continue to select No Carriers, No LHAs, No player navy, No enemy navy etc in campaign options (doesn't matter)\r\n4.

This is very similar to the Tank issue with buying vehicles. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCreate a faction with any aircraft makeup as long as there isn't a CAP capable aircraft in the faction. I tried multiple configurations and while the exact number they buy might change the same thing happens. They will stop before they are full up on slots.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAI factions should buy aircraft till slots are full and utilize them to their capability. Obviously there is a buying priority order and that should still be followed but we need exceptions for non-standard factions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation 3.0 and build # 1932 (current when finding this bug)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI think this is part of what is broken about helicopters also. DCS AI obviously has an issue with helo's also but since the factions won't buy them in any quantity its hard to test what might be the problem.\r\n\r\nI left out log files as there really isn't anything to find, pretty sure there just needs to be an exception added in to the buying system to allow for no CAP planes.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

I will upload the 2 test factions I used, it is the standard PMC Russian faction and a copy with the T-55 added in. This happened with other non-tank factions this is just the testing bed I used to confirm the Bug\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.   Load up any campaign with any blue faction. Use standard PMC - Russian faction. Don't worry about buying your vehicles, just click skip turn. You will see that every time they have bought the same 6 vehicles. You can check the enemy income intel and see they have extra money but won't use it. multiple skipped turns and nothing changes.\r\n2.   Load up the same settings except use the faction provided which is exactly the same except the T-55 has been added. repeat procedure for skipping the first turn and you will see the enemy has bought multiple vehicles, and subsequent turns shows them spending more up the limits of the campaign.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nEither we need clear information of what vehicle classes MUST be in factions so they can be modified and fixed in an update or the enemy should be able to function without certain vehicles. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Uploaded files**\r\nI am adding a clean log file with only the non-tank faction, creation of campaign, and the skipping of 4 turns.\r\nNo mission file was ever created, so there is nothing to upload from that.\r\nBoth Factions I used for testing are added as a txt documents since we can't upload json files here.\r\n\r\n[liberation.log](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6643094/liberation.log)\r\n[pmc_russian.txt](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6643096/pmc_russian.txt)\r\n[pmc_russian_tank.txt](https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/files/6643098/pmc_russian_tank.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version

"**Describe the bug**\r\nIf you say, set up a DEAD flight and click Use Custom Loadout, close the Edit Flight window, then re-open it, the selected loadout changes to Liberation CAS (instead of the original default of Liberation DEAD). The loadout is still your custom loadout. But if you then want to switch back to the default by de-selecting the Use Custom Loadout checkbox, it switches you back to the CAS loadout instead of DEAD. This seems to happen no matter what loadout you pick (I tried DEAD, SEAD, and BAI). It always switches you back to the Liberation CAS loadout.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Set up a package, e.g. DEAD (basically anything other than CAS)\r\n2.

https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation#dcs-bugs.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter the first turn went off without a hitch, i am trying to make another turn full of flights. However, whenever i go to create a custom flight, nothing happens. I thought it was due to no available pilots, but i deleted all the flights so they *should* be all available right?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Delete pre programmed flights\r\n2. Make custom package\r\n3. click \"create\" flight in a package\r\n4.  nothing happens after this\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe flights to generate\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging.

As a result, these flights will never attack their target and move from ingress to egress immediately.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Create game and choose faction with B-52s or F-117s+\r\n2. Buy B-52s or F-117s \r\n3. Pass turn\r\n4. Plan DEAD flight with B-52 or F-117 on any enemy air defence group\r\n5. TAKE OFF\r\n6.

Instead, the 'pinpoint strike' task is chosen, but no target is created. In my opinion, the easiest way to fix this is to remove the SEAD and DEAD roles from these aircraft and have them execute these types of flights with 'Strike' as default.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1086/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1086/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1084", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1084/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1084/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1084/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/1084", "id": 892571437, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU4OTI1NzE0Mzc=", "number": 1084, "title": "[Build 1554] Dragging Waypoints Does Not Adjust BARCAP Commit Bubble Until You Click Away", "user": {"login": "Mustang-25", "id": 72566076, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTY2MDc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72566076?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mustang-25", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mustang-25/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-05-16T01:16:34Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-16T04:58:15Z", "closed_at": "2021-05-16T04:58:15Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "As described in the title, after you drag a waypoint, the BARCAP commit range bubble does not update until you select a different package then go back to the one you adjusted.

Start new campaign wizard\r\n2. Untick \"use preset\" in time period section.\r\n3. Use arrows to increment starting date to September.\r\n4. Complete wizard with all default options.\r\n5. Observe that campaign reverts to June 1995 instead of custom date.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nfor the campaign to use selected custom date\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nBuild 1384. Bug is **_not_** 100% consistent, but seems to be occur most frequently when using the Mid-90s Summer preset, which is the default starting one.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/992/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/992/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/991", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/991/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/991/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/991/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/991", "id": 862136413, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU4NjIxMzY0MTM=", "number": 991, "title": "Blue auto-buy planner only buys 10 units instead of 30 when unit transfer option is enabled", "user": {"login": "Hornet2041", "id": 55866858, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODY2ODU4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55866858?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041", "html_url": "https://github.com/Hornet2041", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Hornet2041/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-04-19T23:54:48Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-20T00:26:43Z", "closed_at": "2021-04-20T00:26:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nBlue ground unit auto buyer should buy up to 30 units.

You can see neither the carrier BARCAP, nor the Gudauta BARCAP missions are plotted where they could act as a barrier before they units they're protecting are attacked\r\n\r\n![BarCap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77306573/109897768-318e1880-7c61-11eb-962a-7ec05b19da7b.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Liberation Caucus.zip](https://github.com/Khopa/dcs_liberation/files/6080300/Liberation.Caucus.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/934/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/934/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/933", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/933/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/933/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/933/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/933", "id": 820847200, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU4MjA4NDcyMDA=", "number": 933, "title": "Tanker positioning", "user": {"login": "Meyomyx", "id": 70166005, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTY2MDA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70166005?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx", "html_url": "https://github.com/Meyomyx", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Meyomyx/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2021-03-03T07:45:03Z", "updated_at": "2021-07-16T00:24:04Z", "closed_at": "2021-07-16T00:24:04Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I see there is a suggestion that is related to tanker placement.

Then after both terminals closed I started Liberation for the last time.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/904/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/904/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/903", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/903/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/903/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/903/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/903", "id": 812465944, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU4MTI0NjU5NDQ=", "number": 903, "title": "Unable to end turn due to navmesh error", "user": {"login": "Starfire13", "id": 72491792, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDkxNzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72491792?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starfire13", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starfire13/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": {"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "DanAlbert", "id": 315852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTg1Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanAlbert", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanAlbert/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2021-02-20T01:04:38Z", "updated_at": "2021-03-13T21:43:58Z", "closed_at": "2021-03-13T21:43:48Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-02-20 11:58:05,788 :: INFO :: Finishing event AirWar\r\n2021-02-20 11:58:05,789 :: INFO :: Committing mission results\r\n2021-02-20 11:58:05,789 :: INFO :: <class 'dcs.planes.FA_18C_hornet'> destroyed from CVN-75 Harry S.

It consistently starts in the air. Upon re-opening Liberation, it has become an \"air start\" flight. Save it as \"cold start\" and it reverts to an air start flight.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, it seems that the Syria map / A10 parking is bugged in that the A10 only has a few parking spots showing that can be used. Other aircraft do not seem to be affected and have the full number of spots available. Thus if the number of A10 aircraft exceed this small number of parking spots, the flight will be converted by the mission editor into an \"air start\" flight above that air base. The route isn't affected - including arrival back at the same airbase.\r\n\r\nWith \"automatic aircraft purchase\" in operation, Liberation has purchased more A10 aircraft than can start from the ground - which is the cause of my problem.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is a bug with the Syria Map. At Al Dumayr, for example, there are 57 parking slots available but only 4 can be used by the A10.\r\n\r\nObviously fixable by changing aircraft although auto purchasing could do with not buying any more A10's! I can free up a user space by creating an extra user flight that isn't flown.

Have not attempted for other factions.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Modify F-4E Custom Payload - specifically to give F-4Es AIM-7Es and AIM-9P5s\r\n2. Check Mission Editor\r\n3. Equipped with stock loadout including 7Fs and 9Ms\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpected F-4Es to use AIM-7Es which I'm assuming were what we sold to Iran.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are locaed in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation 2.4\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/848/reactions",

Only affects carrier aircraft (and regardless of their start type).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n0. Aircraft default to Runway Start\r\n1. Create an Attack Airfield mission\r\n2. Add any type of flight; SEAD, Escort, OCA/Airfield, etc. from a carrier.\r\n3.

Should be a simple fix, all that needs replacing is the Hercules_Cargo.lua file located in \\dcs_liberation\\resources\\plugins\\herculescargo . I've sent the replacement file in #bug-report channel in the Discord, but you can also DM me at Haydz#0444 on Discord if you want me to send the file directly that way.\r\n\r\nThe other (more minor) bug is the radio frequency that the Hercules is tuned to by default in DCS Liberation - it attempts a NATO UHF frequency, however the Hercules mod can only accept frequencies from 118 to 143 MHz AM. This is not a major issue as the Hercules mod currently has non-functioning radios, so players will be unable to send/receive transmissions from the aircraft anyway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/782/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/782/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/781", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/781/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/781/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/781/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/781", "id": 787802219, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU3ODc4MDIyMTk=", "number": 781, "title": "DCS Lib 2.3.4 - Carrier / Tarawa missing from Desert War Campaign (Persian Gulf) - Bug or Feature?", "user": {"login": "Rook-US", "id": 77588852, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTg4ODUy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77588852?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US", "html_url": "https://github.com/Rook-US", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Rook-US/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2021-01-17T21:48:00Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-17T23:20:17Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-17T23:20:17Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Went hunting for issues related to Carrier spawns, but could only find a suggestion for Carriers on all maps, so I'm posting this just in case it's a bug.\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nNoticed that a new Desert War campaign was not generating the carrier groups. Looks like the carrier spawns in the base desert_war.miz file have been replaced by speed boats. Not sure if this was done to remove carrier spawns from Desert War, or if its a bug.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the behavior**:\r\n1. Create a new Desert Campaign in DCS Lib 2.3.4\r\n2. Enable Supercarrier / Or not(haven't tested this part)\r\n3. Observe no carrier groups on Liberation campaign map, or in the mission editor when loading up next turn.\r\n\r\n**Additional info**:\r\nUsing other .miz files as reference, swapped in the Stennis and Tarawa on the Speedboat units. After doing this, a new Desert War campaign generated the carrier groups and seems to be adding them to mission files correctly. Ran through the mission in DCS, everything seemed to function normally.

Not sure if other airbases will work or not work yet.\r\n(2) For testing purposes, I removed all RED and BLUE groups except player a/c.\r\n(3) Deliver ordnance.\r\n(4) Watch ordnance hit.\r\n(5) See \"dead\" event in briefing.\r\n(6) Exit mission.\r\n(7) Accept results in Liberation.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n\r\n(a) ``state.json`` correctly registers the airfield as destroyed, twice under \"killed_ground_units\" and twice under \"destroyed_ground objects\".\r\n(b) Yet Liberation incorrectly does not recognize anything destroyed or lost, and declares the runway still operational.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nLiberation should declare runway as inoperational.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging. Include as much of the following as you are able:\r\n\r\n- DCS Liberation save file (the `.liberation` file you save from the DCS Liberation window). By default these are located in your DCS saved games directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS`).\r\n- The generated mission file (the `.miz` file that you load in DCS to play the turn). By default these are located in your missions directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/DCS/Missions`).\r\n- A tacview track file, especially when demonstrating an issue with AI behavior. By default these are locaed in your Tacview tracks directory (`%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Tacview`).\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n - DCS Liberation [e.g. 2.3.1]: e174c1b (build #956)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a disconnect between the airfield name in DCS vs Liberation's internal database? I recall that a recent patch in DCS may have changed a number of airfield names.\r\n\r\n[rwy1.zip](https://github.com/Khopa/dcs_liberation/files/5780479/rwy1.zip)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/741/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/741/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/740", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/740/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/740/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/740/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/740", "id": 780888876, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU3ODA4ODg4NzY=", "number": 740, "title": "state.json file gives wrong results when MP mission is hosted in local", "user": {"login": "Aigle-2", "id": 70283408, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjgzNDA4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70283408?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aigle-2", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aigle-2/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2021-01-06T22:31:42Z", "updated_at": "2021-01-07T20:35:47Z", "closed_at": "2021-01-07T19:54:16Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen my group plays liberation (I usually hosts), results at the end of the mission make no sense.

Create Syrian Civil War Campaign (USA 2005, Libya 2011)\r\n2. Disable `AI planes parking start (AI starts in flight if disabled)`\r\n3. Load up `Bassel Al` with F16s and F18s\r\n4. Have player flight _not_ at `Bassel Al`\r\n5. Make all packages TOT's `ASAP`\r\n6. Watch traffic at `Bassel Al`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n- Friendly planes should start in air instead of at ramp when disabling `AI planes parking start (AI starts in flight if disabled)`\r\n- When `AI planes parking start (AI starts in flight if disabled)` is enabled, planes shouldn't be taxiing into each other.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nRan into this on the first mission of a campaign:\r\n![Standoff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74509817/103724202-0654b900-4f91-11eb-9433-c7f09198e06f.png)\r\n\r\nWith `AI planes parking start (AI starts in flight if disabled)` **enabled** planes were taxiing to block each other.

This would also provide incentive to capture a base without destroying all its parked aircraft.\r\n\r\n**Version information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - DCS Liberation 2.3.2\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/697/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/697/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/695", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/695/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/695/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/695/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/issues/695", "id": 775715579, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU3NzU3MTU1Nzk=", "number": 695, "title": "Wind direction on DCS Liberation menu bar is depicted incorectly", "user": {"login": "qwertymanisalive", "id": 39744809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzQ0ODA5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39744809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive", "html_url": "https://github.com/qwertymanisalive", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/qwertymanisalive/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 1018814178, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODE0MTc4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dcs-liberation/dcs_liberation/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2020-12-29T06:01:37Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-19T09:22:27Z", "closed_at": "2020-12-29T07:35:04Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "![lib winds](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39744809/103261867-ddf90900-4957-11eb-8d08-905cf6139695.PNG)\r\n![mission editor wind](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39744809/103261874-e7827100-4957-11eb-972e-8635fb43bbed.PNG)\r\n\r\nBefore filing, please search the issue tracker to see if the issue has already been reported.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWind should be depicted as wind from a direction, not wind to a direction. 353 degrees at 2 knots is wind from the north, not wind blowing to the north.

description as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWithout a custom loadout, various airplanes and helicopters come with either an excessive loadout (F/A-18C has missiles stacked to the brim), an odd loadout (A10-C II carrying only double rack 9Ms), or a partial ammo count (UH-1H with 300 bullets in each minigun but side gunner with full ammo), instead of an entirely blank loadout like they should have upon joining the mission.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create flight and edit it with desired waypoints/tasks\r\n2. Do not set a custom loadout\r\n3. Take-off and load mission (either SP or MP)\r\n4. Load into F/A-18 or other plane and observe loadout not being blank.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLoading into an empty airship or rotor craft. \r\n\r\nWe will usually need more information for debugging.

A ship objective is generated on land (PYTHON) in the Liberation map but it is properly placed on water in the ME\r\n\r\n5. Egress points for the planned anti-ship strikes take them directly over enemy SAM sites\r\n\r\n6. The F-15C can be fragged for an anti-ship strike in Liberation but it will default to CAS in the ME (presumably other aircraft that are pure A2A will have this same problem)\r\n\r\n7.

When I came to play turn 3 the only ground vehicles I had listed and visible in the mission editor were ones I had not moved all others were missing (which had not been stated destroyed in the end of turn report) also some of the Sam sites I had destroyed had respawned but with different Sam systems. \r\nI am going to play another round to see if this occurs again.
