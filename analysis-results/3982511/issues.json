https://readthedocs.org/profiles/barry/\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nOnce I set up an integration, I expect it to keep working.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nIt seems like integrations are getting lost after a day or a few hours.  Case in point: [flufl.enum](https://gitlab.com/warsaw/flufl.enum) is one of the projects that I maintain on GitLab and publish docs on RTD.  I've just recently started making changes to this project again after some time off.  I noticed that new MRs were not building their draft documentation and there was no External test for RTD on the MR pipeline.  I tried to resync the webhook, but this failed, telling me I had to check my permissions.  I went to my Connected Services and saw both GitLab and GitHub still there.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that maybe I should delete my GitLab Connected Service, and re-add it.  After I did that, I went back to my flufl.enum integrations page and was able to resync my web hook.  After that, pushes to my MR all worked as expected; my draft documentation got built, and my MR pipeline showed an external test pointing to RTD.\r\n\r\nAfter a day or so, I pushed a new change to my MR and again noticed that the GitLab/RTD integration was broken, just as above.  Hmm.  I did the same thing, i.e. deleted my GitLab Connected Service, re-added it, then resync'd my flufl.enum webhook, and again, everything started working again.  Okay I thought, maybe it was just a glitch.\r\n\r\nWell, just now I noticed the *same thing happening again*.  A new MR, and no external test for RTD in my [pipeline](https://gitlab.com/warsaw/flufl.enum/-/pipelines/622347178).  So I went through the dance again of deleting my GitLab connected service, re-adding it, then resyncing my webhook.  And now it's working again.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a recurring problem.  My connection to my GitLab account or the webhook just keeps getting dropped after some amount of time.  This affects other projects that I host on GitLab and publish on RTD.  I have not tested the same scenario with GitHub.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9548/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

the result expected.\r\n\r\nWhile you're browsing `zhyantao.github.io` > `view the source code`, you can always find the following source code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar addUtterances = () => {\r\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\r\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\r\n    script.src = \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\";\r\n    script.async = \"async\";\r\n\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"repo\", \"zhyantao/zhyantao.github.io\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", \"pathname\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"github-light\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"label\", \"comments\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\r\n\r\n    sections = document.querySelectorAll(\"div.section\");  // Need to change div.section to div>section\r\n    if (sections !== null) {\r\n        section = sections[sections.length-1];\r\n        section.appendChild(script);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncommentsRunWhenDOMLoaded(addUtterances);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are some of the key points I think:\r\n\r\n- [python scripts/fix-comments.py](https://github.com/zhyantao/zhyantao.github.io/blob/v1.5.0/.readthedocs.yaml#L23) (`.readthedocs.yaml`)\r\n- [fix-comments.py](https://github.com/zhyantao/zhyantao.github.io/blob/v1.5.0/scripts/fix-comments.py) (`scripts/fix-comments.py`)\r\n- blog page: [https://zhyantao.github.io](https://zhyantao.github.io)\r\n\r\nWhat I do in the `fix-comments.py` is just replace `div.section` to `div>section`, but that doesn't take effect.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way I can verify this is by typing the following code on the console:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar addUtterances = () => {\r\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\r\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\r\n    script.src = \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\";\r\n    script.async = \"async\";\r\n\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"repo\", \"zhyantao/zhyantao.github.io\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", \"pathname\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"theme\", \"github-light\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"label\", \"comments\");\r\n    script.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\r\n\r\n    sections = document.querySelectorAll(\"div>section\"); // modified\r\n    if (sections !== null) {\r\n        section = sections[sections.length-1];\r\n        section.appendChild(script);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncommentsRunWhenDOMLoaded(addUtterances);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, wait a moment, and you'll see it works. I can see comments block in the web page.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9172/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9172/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9151", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9151/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9151/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9151/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9151", "id": 1218380608, "node_id": "I_kwDOAAzYa85InwNA", "number": 9151, "title": "Analytics: normalize URL so they are counted properly", "user": {"login": "humitos", "id": 244656, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY1Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244656?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos", "html_url": "https://github.com/humitos", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}, {"id": 959209528, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTkyMDk1Mjg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Accepted", "name": "Accepted", "color": "10ff91", "default": false, "description": "Accepted issue on our roadmap"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2022-04-28T08:26:37Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-25T18:48:17Z", "closed_at": "2022-05-25T18:48:17Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I just saw that we have the same URL displayed twice and counted separately.

It has been working fine until today.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nThis environment variable was present on an RTD Github CI build around 1pm US Eastern today (29 Mar 2022): https://readthedocs.org/projects/ompi/builds/16504767/\r\n\r\nBut about 15 minutes later, this environment variable was no longer in the RTD Github CI build environment (at about 1:11pm US Eastern 29 Mar 2022), resulting in a KeyError Python error from our `conf.py` file when we try to access `os.environ['READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE']`: https://readthedocs.org/projects/ompi/builds/16504880/\r\n\r\nLooking at the git history in this repo, it looks like the `READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE` functionality was introduced in PR #8237.  But later, when PR #9002 was merged, it looks like at least part of #8237 was (unintentionally?) reverted.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, it looks like `get_rtd_env_vars()` was moved from [here](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/9002/files#diff-a1de8bb51275b9023d77549c15a85c45c68867cd8257ff48d67b8590d5afc8c6L172-L190) to

carried over.\r\n\r\nCan `READTHEDOCS_VERSION_TYPE` functionality be restored?\r\n\r\nThanks for ReadTheDocs.io!", "reactions": {"url":

https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10028/ and those changes break our custom server side search feature (SSS), and it also breaks the search page on our theme (with or without our SSS).\r\n\r\nThe first problems were reported at https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8862.\r\n\r\n- `Seach.init` is being called twice, duplicating some elements (will be fixed with https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-sphinx-ext/pull/100)\r\n- Our custom js that replaces Sphinx's default search with our SSS assumes that some attributes from the `Search` object are jQuery objects, but after the refactor done upstream, they will be HTML/Node object\r\n\r\n  We need to check all usages of `Sphinx.*` and decide what to do. \r\n\r\n  - https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/e7102a4d7f0c5169f6b54796a43b39f7f88d4c70/readthedocs/core/static-src/core/js/doc-embed/search.js#L209\r\n  All calls to `Sphinx.{element}.text()` should be easy to fix, we can have a utility function that checks if the element is an jQuery object, something like\r\n\r\n      ```js\r\n      const setText = function(node, text) {\r\n        if (node.jquery) {\r\n          node.text(text);\r\n        } else {\r\n          node.innerText = text;\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  - https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/e7102a4d7f0c5169f6b54796a43b39f7f88d4c70/readthedocs/core/static-src/core/js/doc-embed/search.js#L209-L211\r\n\r\n    I think we can delete that call to `.fadeIn`, it's done at the end of the search operation, so at this stage the text from `Sphinx.status` is already shown. Actually, I think this was meant to be `Sphinx.title.fadeIn`.\r\n\r\n  -  https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/e7102a4d7f0c5169f6b54796a43b39f7f88d4c70/readthedocs/core/static-src/core/js/doc-embed/search.js#L191-L192\r\n    \r\n     `list_item` is a jQuery object (we are making heavy use of jQuery to create that element), but now `Search.output` will be an HTML/Node object, we can do something like this:\r\n        \r\n        ```js\r\n        if (Search.output.jquery) {\r\n          Search.output.append(list_item);\r\n          list_item.slideDown(5);\r\n        } else {\r\n          Search.output.appendChild(list_item.get(0));\r\n          // No slideDown for the non-jquery version.\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n- If some expected elements aren't on the search page, the search operation will fail.\r\n  \r\n    https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/3b01fbe2adf3077cad5c2cf345c6d000d429d7ac/sphinx/themes/basic/static/searchtools.js#L211-L213\r\n  \r\n  Our theme completely overrides the search page, and it doesn't inherit from Sphinx's default search page\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/blob/d64dadf1ceec4f9ff6c1ca2d3ea4c3d0fdb0e8d2/sphinx_rtd_theme/search.html#L10\r\n\r\n   When retrieving a non-existent element, jQuery would still return an object (kind of empty one, so method calls won't raise a null exception), but now `getElementById` will return  `null` and raise an exception when trying to call a method on that value.\r\n\r\n   We can fix this in our theme (by adding that element or by inheriting from sphinx's search page to avoid things like this in the future),\r\n   or we can also send a patch to sphinx to not assume that that element will always be present (it's used in 2 places only, so it shouldn't be a problem) https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10153.\r\n\r\n### Another approach\r\n\r\nAnother way to solve most of these problems is to stop relying on sphinx's `Search` object and create and display the elements by ourselves, the mkdocs implementation doesn't rely on any mkdocs internals to display the search results.\r\nThis way, if sphinx changes the internals of the `Search` object, we won't be affected.\r\n\r\nA downside would be that the structure/classes of the containers wouldn't be dictated by sphinx anymore,\r\nso if our structure is different from the one expected for that version of sphinx, the styles may look off if the theme doesn't play nice with our structure.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10153\r\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10233\r\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10244\r\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10245\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThose are the issues I have found so far, additionally Sphinx will soon be dropping jQuery too (and we make heavy use of jQuery in our injected footer and friends).", "reactions": {"url":

It contains the following breaking change:\r\n\r\n> Embedded MinIO Browser removed replaced with MinIO Console project https://github.com/minio/console, this is a **breaking** change\r\n> > MinIO redirects browser access requests to the configured server port (i.e. `127.0.0.1:9000`) to the configured Console port. MinIO uses the hostname or IP address specified in the request when building the redirect URI. The URL and port *must* be accessible by the client for the redirection to work\r\n\r\nThis breaks the current development setup in 2 ways:\r\n1) `http://localhost:9000/` now redirects to `http://localhost:<some_port>/ ` where `<some_port>` is dynamically generated at MinIO startup. Since this port isn't forwarded, you can't configure MinIO:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   WARNING: MINIO_ACCESS_KEY and MINIO_SECRET_KEY are deprecated.\r\n            Please use MINIO_ROOT_USER and

manually add the `--console-address` setting and forward the appropriate port, the [instructions in step 7](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/install.html) still don't make sense,

This makes that repository to not being able to import by that user.\r\n\r\nWe are using 3 different API endpoints to sync `RemoteRepository` on GitLab:\r\n\r\nIn `GitLabService.sync_repositories`:\r\n\r\n* `{url}/api/v4/projects`: to get all the projects the user has access to ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#list-all-projects))\r\n\r\n> Note that we [exclude repositories to be imported](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/2d64328ea88626925836e8cb8594a605c80cd3c4/readthedocs/oauth/services/gitlab.py#L175-L180) if they belong to a _different_ organization at this point\r\n\r\nIn `GitLabService.sync_organizations`:\r\n\r\n* `{url}/api/v4/groups`: to get all the groups the user belongs to ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#list-groups))\r\n* `{url}/api/v4/groups/{id}/projects`: to get all the projects for a particular group the user belongs to ([docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#list-a-groups-projects)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is that the API response from `/groups/{id}/projects` *is not the same* than `/projects`. In particular the later comes with the `permissions` field that is _key_ for us to know if the user is admin or not.\r\n\r\nSo, the first time that `sync_repositories` is called, we create the `RemoteRepository` properly for this repository but then when `sync_organizations` is called, we overwrite it with the new updated data (response without `permissions`) and link it to the `RemoteOrganization`. The next time this remote repository is updated via `sync_repositories` will be skipped as mentioned in the note.\r\n\r\nThe quickest solution is to make a new API call to get a single project with _all its fields_ including `permissions`, hitting https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#get-single-project for each item returned in `{url}/api/v4/groups/{id}/projects`,\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/blob/2d64328ea88626925836e8cb8594a605c80cd3c4/readthedocs/oauth/services/gitlab.py#L111-L120\r\n\r\nThis will work, but we are adding extra calls to the API to re-fetch data that we already asked for while syncing repositories (before syncing organizations). We could find a way to share this data, but the code will more complex.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/7743/reactions", "total_count": 0,

to keep older versions available in the doc if possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, if it can help, the last successful build for my project was on 2020-01-31T10:34:03.130141Z : https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/10360658.txt and the first failing build was on 2020-02-05T08:40:45.500491Z https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/10386322.txt.\r\n\r\nThe logs inside both these builds seem to be quite different, for example, the successful build does the following : \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit remote set-url origin https://github.com/open-xml-templating/docxtemplater.git\r\ngit fetch origin --force --tags --prune --prune-tags --depth 50\r\ngit checkout --force origin/master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failing build does the following : \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone --no-single-branch --depth 50 https://github.com/open-xml-templating/docxtemplater.git .\r\ngit checkout --force origin/master\r\ngit clean -d -f -f\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I suspect there might have been a big change in readthedocs between those two dates (or something else happened which I don't understand).\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/6712/reactions",

We basically never want to do this.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -IL https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api\r\nHTTP/2 301\r\n...\r\nlocation: http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis is most visible with dirhtml builds where a trailing slash is often omitted and curling `https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/api/` directly is fine. This affects subdomain docs too (`*.readthedocs.io`) but in a different manner (HTTPS -> HTTP -> HTTPS again):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -IL https://flask.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.x/api\r\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\n...\r\nLocation: http://flask.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.x/api/\r\n...\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\n...\r\nLocation: https://flask.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.x/api/\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt affects non-dirhtml docs as well although it isn't as visible because the issue is hit pretty infrequently because most requests end with `.html`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -IL https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file\r\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\n...\r\nLocation: http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/\r\n```\r\n\r\n~My current best guess is that this is due to the [nginx `try_files` directive](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#try_files) using the first listener which is port 80.~ For subdomain docs, we have a blanket HTTP -> HTTPS redirect so this problem is masked although not really resolved. We can't do a blanket redirect for all custom domains because many people have not correctly setup their custom domain such that RTD can issue a certificate. (see https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4641)\r\n\r\nThis also affects the redirects in place for `$lang/$version`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ curl -IL https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable\r\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\r\n...\r\nLocation: http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\r\n...\r\n```", "reactions": {"url":

I ran into resource constraints early on, and the RTD docs [recommended using the system versions](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/build-using-too-many-resources.html) of numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. rather than putting them all in the requirements.txt for the doc environment.\r\n\r\nThus, in my `.readthedocs.yml` I have:\r\n```yaml\r\npython:\r\n  version: 3.7\r\n  install:\r\n    - requirements: docs/requirements.txt\r\n  system_packages: true\r\n```\r\nand in `docs/requirements.txt` I have:\r\n```\r\ndbfread\r\nsqlalchemy\r\nsphinx==2.1.1\r\n# from read-the-docs system python:\r\n# scipy\r\n# numpy\r\n# matplotlib\r\n# pandas\r\n```\r\nHowever, my pinned sphinx version only gets used sometimes. Other times the system sphinx v1.8.5 ends up being used (and not finding my index.rst... causing an error).  If I change something trivial and re-commit, triggering a new build, sometimes it works. Maybe this is another manifestation of #5350, but the fact that it only happens sometimes seems really strange.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the failed build below, the log indicates that the correct version of sphinx is being found in the build environment, but then it's not being used:\r\n```\r\nRequirement already satisfied: sphinx==2.1.1 in /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/catalyst-cooperative-pudl/envs/doc-setup/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from -r docs/requirements.txt (line 3)) (2.1.1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Read the Docs project URL: https://catalyst-cooperative-pudl.readthedocs.io/\r\n* Build URL (if applicable):\r\n  * A build that used sphinx 1.8.5:

the Docs username (if applicable): zaneselvans\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\nExpected that the pinned version of sphinx in my `docs/requirements.txt` file would set the version of sphinx used to build my documentation.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\nThe pre-installed system sphinx version 1.8.5 takes precedence... but only *sometimes* for reasons that I don't understand.\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

When I `wipe` a build, all extra search related utilities should be cleared as well.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nWhen you visit the URL https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/search.html?q=ButtonGroup&check_keywords=yes&area=default that came from searching for `ButtonGroup` in the top left of https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ currently you get three links\r\n\r\n- (valid) https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/program_listing_file_nanogui_button.h.html?highlight=ButtonGroup\r\n- (not valid) https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/class_nanogui__Button.html?highlight=ButtonGroup\r\n- (valid) https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/classnanogui_1_1Button.html?highlight=ButtonGroup\r\n\r\nThe tool that generates these docs used to create the now invalid url (`class_nanogui__Button.html`), but now it generates the third link (`classnanogui_1_1Button.html`).  But I can't seem to get it out of the search results by wiping the build.\r\n\r\nFor reference, if you download the sphinx searchindex is correct:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ wget https://nanogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/searchindex.js\r\n$ cat searchindex.js | sed 's/,/,\\n/g' | grep api/ | grep -i button | sort\r\n\"api/classnanogui_1_1Button\",\r\n\"api/classnanogui_1_1Button.rst\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that it seems that when I wipe my project and trigger a new build, the sphinx `searchindex.js` `docnames` gets updated as expected, but whatever extra voodoo search magic RTD is doing is somehow hanging onto the cached entries that are no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThis seems potentially related to and or maybe caused by what affects #4452 , but this is true for all users (not related to login credentials, same results in private browser).  I don't understand enough about how the extra search stuff works to offer any real insight, this may be a hard one to solve if it's not as easy as \"oh yeah delete _this_ too when `wipe` is issued\".", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5668/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5668/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5658", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5658/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5658/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5658/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5658", "id": 439583278, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0Mzk1ODMyNzg=", "number": 5658, "title": "pypy3.5 virtualenv does not support venv re-creation", "user": {"login": "humitos", "id": 244656, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY1Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244656?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos", "html_url": "https://github.com/humitos", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}, {"id": 959209528, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw5NTkyMDk1Mjg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Accepted", "name": "Accepted", "color": "10ff91", "default": false, "description": "Accepted issue on our roadmap"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 4, "created_at": "2019-05-02T13:11:36Z", "updated_at": "2019-08-06T09:40:32Z", "closed_at": "2019-08-06T09:40:31Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Setting `Project.container_image` to `pypy3.5` works the first time.

so I've looked into the problem. It started when I changed how they were laid out, or more specifically when I took the MkDocs configuration file out of the root folder, in this [commit](https://github.com/orlnub123/django-class-settings/commit/629bae1f2362129498fc9989af9881b99f96801b). The only hint was the difference at the end of the build outputs from the commit before and the commits since that successfully built.\r\n\r\nHere's the output from the commit before:\r\n```\r\n[rtd-command-info] start-time: 2018-12-12T15:24:31.500295Z, end-time: 2018-12-12T15:24:32.154653Z, duration: 0, exit-code: 0\r\npython /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/envs/latest/bin/mkdocs build --clean --site-dir _build/html --config-file /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/checkouts/latest/mkdocs.yml\r\nINFO    -  Cleaning site directory\r\nINFO    -  Building documentation to directory: /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/checkouts/latest/_build/html\r\n```\r\nAnd the output from the earliest successfully built commit after:\r\n```\r\n[rtd-command-info] start-time: 2019-03-06T09:01:08.583601Z, end-time: 2019-03-06T09:01:09.203502Z, duration: 0, exit-code: 0\r\npython /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/envs/latest/bin/mkdocs build --clean --site-dir _build/html --config-file /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/checkouts/latest/docs/mkdocs.yml\r\nINFO    -  Cleaning site directory\r\nINFO    -  Building documentation to directory: /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/django-class-settings/checkouts/latest/docs/_build/html\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you look closely you'll see that while the first one builds into `_build/html`, the one after builds into `docs/_build/html`. I haven't tested it but I'm guessing this discrepancy is why the docs aren't updating, even after environment resets.\r\n\r\nThe reason it's getting built into a different directory is because of the build command: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/5f78337874cb7dd0f73864d43283fe819d03594d/readthedocs/doc_builder/backends/mkdocs.py#L249-L258\r\n\r\nThe directory passed to `--site-dir`, `self.build_dir`, gets set to `_build/html` here: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/5f78337874cb7dd0f73864d43283fe819d03594d/readthedocs/doc_builder/backends/mkdocs.py#L294-L297\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because MkDocs assumes local paths to be local to the configuration file, not to the current working directory. The change happens here: https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/blob/eb5f3f84e533cff42e13492af2a5e1ab391865e9/mkdocs/config/config_options.py#L341-L342\r\n\r\nA fix would be to change `self.build_dir` to be an absolute path if the MkDocs configuration file isn't inside the root directory.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5559/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5559/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5553", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5553/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5553/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5553/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5553", "id": 427499154, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU0Mjc0OTkxNTQ=", "number": 5553, "title": "Recommended Docker image does not contain Python 3.7", "user": {"login": "jasonaowen", "id": 1494855, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTQ4NTU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1494855?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen", "html_url": "https://github.com/jasonaowen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jasonaowen/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2019-04-01T03:49:22Z", "updated_at": "2019-05-17T10:15:43Z", "closed_at": "2019-05-17T10:15:42Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "## Details\r\n\r\nThe [instructions for setting up a Docker build environment](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/buildenvironments.html) specify using the `latest` image:\r\n\r\n> To get started using Docker for build environments, you\u2019ll need to pull down at least one build image.

should address by refactoring it:\r\n\r\n* There is currently no way to return `facets` with this approach. It treats each `Hit` as an object, but the `facets` are returned at the top-level. In particular, the serializer doesn't even get access to the facet, because it's only passed each `Hit` object. \r\n* Currently the `count` returned in by the docsearch REST API is wrong. I believe this is because of the way we're filtering the results, but I think it might be happening after pagination.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to work around these limitations, but I think the proper solution is to build the REST API using a custom approach, and pass the data in from Search directly, instead of trying to depend on the fact that `Search`'s look like `Queryset`'s.

I have it working locally in 1.8.2.

It is in this section:\r\n\r\n```\r\n###########################################################################\r\n#          auto-created readthedocs.org specific configuration            #\r\n###########################################################################\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it is failing in this part of the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sphinx import version_info\r\n\r\n# Get suffix for proper linking to GitHub\r\n# This is deprecated in Sphinx 1.3+,\r\n# as each page can have its own suffix\r\nif globals().get('source_suffix', False):\r\n    if isinstance(source_suffix, string_types):\r\n        SUFFIX = source_suffix\r\n    else:\r\n        SUFFIX = source_suffix[0]  <== this is the line showing up in the error message\r\nelse:\r\n    SUFFIX = '.rst'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the error text I see online:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException occurred:\r\n  File \"conf.py\", line 526, in <module>\r\n    SUFFIX = source_suffix[0]\r\nKeyError: 0\r\nThe full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-Sy7Cam.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.\r\nPlease also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.\r\nA bug report can be filed in the tracker at <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues>. Thanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\nI'm posting this here instead of the sphinx repo because it builds successfully locally, so doesn't seem to be a sphinx problem.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I need to do on my side to fix this, or do you need to modify something on your end?\r\n\r\nAlso, as a side note, could it be related to the fact that you are running such an old version of sphinx (1.4)?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks --

(jquery.js:33)\r\n\r\nThe behavior is like JQuery 1.2.1 is actually used and not JQuery 3.2.1 that is bundled: https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/master/_static/jquery-3.2.1.js\r\n\r\nI do not believe this is a Sphinx problem, as building with Sphinx 1.7.9 locally works fine (not in Chrome but Firefox). (no version switcher though.) The readthedocs builds uses \"-T -E -b readthedocs\" instead of \"-b html\" \r\nIf I install the readthedocs extension I get this problem too:\r\npip install https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs-sphinx-ext/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\nThe previous build for 2.51 a couple of months ago worked https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.51\r\nbut unfortunately that was rebuilt. The log from the previous working build looks similar to the new builds though.\r\nOlder builds (a year and a half ago) works OK, but they use different versions (JQuery 2.0 for instance) and is hard to compare.\r\n\r\nThe only error I see in the logfile is \r\n```copying static files...

The exact code that does this is https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/zuul-jobs/tree/roles/trigger-readthedocs/tasks/main.yaml#n11\r\n\r\nBut in essence that boils down to (for, say jenkins-job-builder project)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --request POST -u openstackci:OURPASSWORD https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/webhook/jenkins-job-builder/47271/\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur jobs starting failing around 2018-12-05 (http://zuul.openstack.org/builds?job_name=trigger-readthedocs-webhook).  The jobs don't log the output of this POST so we don't leak the password into logs.\r\n\r\nHowever, testing manually, the responses indicate a content-length is now required, and a referer, which ends up with\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl --request POST -H \"Content-Length:0\" -u openstackci:PASSWORD -e https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/webhook/jenkins-jo2/webhook/jenkins-job-builder/47271/ https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/webhook/jenkins-jo2/webhook/jenkins-job-builder/47271/\r\n{\"detail\":\"CSRF Failed: CSRF cookie not set.\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing all this points to CSRF has been somehow enabled for webhook endpoints when using HTTP basic-auth?  Is this possibly a new configuration?\r\n\r\nWe don't use the token-based webhook method because this system means we only have one common secret to keep -- the openstackci user password -- and everything else is self-service for projects who simply add the common user as an admin and include in their configuration their endpoint URL.\r\n\r\nAny help with this will be greatly appreciated, thanks", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4986/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4986/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4981", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4981/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4981/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4981/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4981", "id": 389330775, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzODkzMzA3NzU=", "number": 4981, "title": "Validate url from Webhook notification", "user": {"login": "humitos", "id": 244656, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY1Ng==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244656?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos", "html_url": "https://github.com/humitos", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humitos/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestones/16", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/16", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestones/16/labels", "id": 1732392, "node_id": "MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTczMjM5Mg==", "number": 16, "title": "Admin UX", "description": "Fix admin user experience failures.

There were 2 branches (versions) deployed as expected several times after new commits but then we paused our efforts in order to make some refactoring of the library at first.\r\n\r\nYesterday, we started to work on docs again but it was not possible to build a new branch/version. Every attempt to make RTD works finished with the error described above. Moreover, RTD could not build both old branches now, despite the fact that no changes were made to them in the last weeks.\r\nI tried to wipe every version, to recreate the project from scratch several times, but nothing helped.\r\n\r\nToday's update of RTD to 2.6.0 also had no effect. Such error messages as mentioned above give little info for debug, so any thoughts would be appreciated.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4383/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4383/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4378", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4378/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4378/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4378/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4378", "id": 341725912, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUzNDE3MjU5MTI=", "number": 4378, "title": "Invalid \"requirements_file\": path docs/requirements.txt does not exist error", "user": {"login": "Benjamin-Lee", "id": 13618205, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjE4MjA1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13618205?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee", "html_url": "https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Benjamin-Lee/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 219048373, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMTkwNDgzNzM=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Priority:%20high", "name": "Priority: high", "color": "e11d21", "default": false, "description": "High priority"}, {"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2018-07-17T00:42:28Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-17T18:39:05Z", "closed_at": "2018-07-17T18:21:49Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "## Details\r\n\r\n* Read the Docs project URL: squiggle.readthedocs.io\r\n* Build URL (if applicable):\r\n* Read the Docs username (if applicable):\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nBuild to succeed\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\n`Problem parsing YAML configuration.

this was an issue to open here or on the sphinx theme's Github, but since building locally with this theme, the footer isn't injected, I think this is the correct place.", "reactions": {"url":

that are not related to the privacy level but more related to the site/instance we are running (community/corporate site).\r\n\r\nExample, `get_production_media_path` is using this to decide if we need to use `MEDIA_ROOT` or `PRODUCTION_MEDIA_ARTIFACTS`: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/84cefc40f00083cbc74a473ffb4ef890294159a1/readthedocs/projects/models.py#L402\r\n\r\nBesdies, I think that `get_production_media_path` is not a good name for this method and shouldn't have the `production` word on it. Example of usage of this: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/84cefc40f00083cbc74a473ffb4ef890294159a1/readthedocs/search/utils.py#L22-L27\r\n\r\nWhy we can't use just the same method `full_json_path` without worry about where we are each time that method is called?\r\n\r\n> There is a `get_production_media_url` also with the same problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, here https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/blob/84cefc40f00083cbc74a473ffb4ef890294159a1/readthedocs/projects/views/public.py#L185 we have harcoded `/prod_artifacts` and we should find a way to get it from a common place.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs-ext/pull/128", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/4119/reactions",

The effect is that clicking on the \"Read the Docs\"/version at the very bottom of the sidebar does nothing (it should pop up the version selector). Also, on a small screen where the sidebar is hidden by default, clicking on the sidebar button (the symbol of three horizontal bars in the top left corner) has no effect (as opposed to showing the sidebar).\r\n\r\nThe broken behavior can be seen in the current build on the Project URL. When loading that page e.g. in Safari with an open Web Inspector, there is an error message that hints at the problem:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n[Error] TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'SphinxRtdTheme.Navigation.enableSticky')\r\n\t(anonymous function) (index.html:365)\r\n\tf (jquery-2.0.3.min.js:3:2256)\r\n\tfireWith (jquery-2.0.3.min.js:3:3059)\r\n\tready (jquery-2.0.3.min.js:1:12573)\r\n\tge (jquery-2.0.3.min.js:1:10197)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe project uses a [readthedocs.yml](https://github.com/mabuchilab/QNET/blob/6a123ed318488e3bf60e9cd718a78858ef56abd8/readthedocs.yml) file and it's set up to use conda, and also to install the package for which the documentation is generated via pip (`pip_install: true`)\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this is the problem. If I switch from `pip_install` to `setup_py_install` (and adapt the environment.yml file accordingly to install all pip-prerequisites manually), it works fine.\r\n\r\nThe commit that makes everything work is https://github.com/mabuchilab/QNET/commit/cc55fe4d789c32ee25436af4749a2d7d9bc6c2ad\r\n\r\nI've reverted that commit to have a \"broken\" build, which I'll leave up for a few days to give people a chance to look at it.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the problem is that I have `sphinx_rtd_theme` listed in `setup.py`: maybe this overwrites the system-`sphinx-rtd_theme` during the `pip_install` of the package, which doesn't happen with `setup_py_install`?", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3925/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0,

However, the URL is only approx 530 characters long, which whilst being long, should be acceptable I would think. It is long purely because it has to include a signed access token. If I cut the access token out, the url is accepted. Here is a fairly good mockup of the webhook URL I am trying submit, including a fake access token:\r\n\r\n`https://blah.blah.blah.info/notify?message=message_here&subject=DOCS%20FAILIURE&access_tok=DgyppMOXVVJY1I6JlTKFxl7zf2NH0Z8lwcZyy9NlSJnrmZ4AinNfn7nSHGjqGVPiU6UNzjJxDsVSP2IK8tBO-iHjIY2c47ijiN0c5J3Gpj4sPwmns8kWyLLMlNsP0Az29ZOwl3VBAm317jkFiijWJ5bDy.RG3F8Ztdt.20qM7rimwRBxIdQUg6h0-z9iywWK_Cp8DUfiyCAy0KzFgfTuVRJD4YeS57kKDqG_RB6bd_Vtj2dHvOilGmCjMLay9JeCp60xX3Er7PyGMVMcxUMh11xowGFMmhYFVWlOkk0MHLxaG2Ocmgok9I1VHRQbkDN9uJWX2E-vewf84XwGTsiTH-eo3pWiU-c7mweMPF3t9C8XlpHJ1ofpl1dSeqspzHYaDIYvkyhgTxefSNJMuIb2eF1HUQExCyFg22ibbTszDRttRnP01AO`\r\n\r\nAre the folk at readthedocs aware of this, or able to explain why the URL won't be accepted?

Custom CSS [here](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/blob/master/docs/_static/css/custom.css); custom layout [here](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/blob/master/docs/_templates/layout.html).\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nIntermittently, https://dedupe.io/developers/library returns the readthedocs 404 page:\r\n\r\n![readthedocs-404](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/634572/36285151-4daafb4c-125f-11e8-925e-267574cc941f.png)\r\n\r\nSometimes the custom styles fail to load:\r\n\r\n![weird-styles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/634572/36285152-4dc27628-125f-11e8-881e-d9b1bede6e03.png)\r\n\r\n~In the case of the missing styles, the stylesheet still seems to be available from https://dedupe.io/developers/library/en/latest/_static/css/custom.css and is visible in the Resources tab in the dev tools, but the styles aren't applied to the page.~ During response periods where the styles seem wonky, the correponding stylesheets also 404. (See more in [my comment below](https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/3630#issuecomment-366461120).) This makes me think that the 404s are the root of the issue.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, hard refreshing a few times appears to fix the issue, but then the behavior recurs sporadically.\r\n\r\nSome other interesting behavior:\r\n\r\n- I've tested this in Firefox 60.0a1(nightly build) and Chrome 63.0.3239.132, both on Ubuntu 16.04. The behavior happens sporadically in both browsers, although it seems more frequent on Chrome.\r\n- I can't replicate either issue locally, or on the readthedocs subdomain (http://dedupe.readthedocs.io). This makes me think that something is up with the custom domain.\r\n\r\nHere are the Nginx rules we use for proxying the custom domain:\r\n\r\n```nginx\r\n    location /developers/library/ {\r\n        proxy_pass https://dedupe.readthedocs.io/;\r\n        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;\r\n        proxy_set_header X-RTD-SLUG dedupe;\r\n        proxy_connect_timeout 10s;\r\n        proxy_read_timeout 20s;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location /developers/library/index.html {\r\n        return 301 https://dedupe.io/developers/library/;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location /en {\r\n        return 301 https://dedupe.io/developers/library$uri;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how I can debug further would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3630/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3630/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3629", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3629/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3629/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3629/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3629", "id": 297963431, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyOTc5NjM0MzE=", "number": 3629, "title": "Rich text editor on settings page is broken on Chrome & Firefox", "user": {"login": "mithro", "id": 21212, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjEy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21212?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro", "html_url": "https://github.com/mithro", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mithro/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}, {"id": 752846056, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw3NTI4NDYwNTY=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Needed:%20replication", "name": "Needed: replication", "color": "54473F", "default": false, "description": "Bug replication is required"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 8, "created_at": "2018-02-17T00:58:39Z", "updated_at": "2018-03-04T16:04:04Z", "closed_at": "2018-03-04T16:04:04Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "## Details\r\n\r\n* Project URL: https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/vtr-verilog-to-routing/edit/\r\n* Read the Docs username (if applicable): mithro\r\n\r\nThe editor widget for a project description in the settings page seems to be broken on Chrome.

This post reiterates this plan and includes a timeline detailing when site operators may need to obtain new certificates.\r\n\r\nNow that SSL certificates can be [gotten for free from LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) it would probably be a good idea to move sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nThe bam.nr-data.net URL seems to come from some type of beacon or error reporting functionality?\r\n```html\r\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n...\r\nNREUM.info={\r\n \"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\r\n \"queueTime\":0,\r\n \"licenseKey\":\"97a187b9fc\",\r\n \"agent\":\"\",\r\n \"transactionName\":\"Y1ZSNktWWkEDBUdbDVocdhdXVEBbDQgcQAdVV0QKXFNbURFIQ0ANXlZTFkoZQlsHEUAcEkZaRgNNUg5iEAlZVwFAZkAGWENRHAUDRw==\",\r\n \"applicationID\":\"2379096\",\r\n \"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\r\n \"applicationTime\":140}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3628/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3628/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3587", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3587/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3587/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3587/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/3587", "id": 295454528, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyOTU0NTQ1Mjg=", "number": 3587, "title": "Github webhook stopped working, resync fails", "user": {"login": "dplanella", "id": 1689781, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODk3ODE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1689781?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella", "html_url": "https://github.com/dplanella", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dplanella/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 9, "created_at": "2018-02-08T10:14:43Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-16T19:55:23Z", "closed_at": "2018-08-16T19:55:23Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "## Details\r\n\r\n* Project URL: http://adafruit-beaglebone-io-python.readthedocs.io\r\n* Build URL: https://readthedocs.org/projects/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/builds/\r\n* Read the Docs username: dplanella\r\n* Upstream: https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python/blob/master/docs/index.rst\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\n- Documentation is automatically built upon an upstream git commit\r\n- The latest tags are pulled as a result and can be enabled for documentation builds in the readthedocs admin interface\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nBoth points above used to work until about two months ago.

For a couple of projects, the `stable` builds are stuck on an old *branch* (whereas typically `stable` stays up-to-date with the highest sequence *tag*). \r\n\r\nOriginally, this seemed like a project specific glitch, but it appears `stable` is pinned to the `16R` branch for all the projects which contain that specific branch name.  \r\n\r\nBelow are the attempts made so far to try and get the projects updating as expected, with no luck:\r\n   - Restarting the server\r\n   - Updating the stable Identifier in the Django project dashboard\r\n   - Deleting and re-creating the project from the Django admin dashboard\r\n   - Removing the 16R tag from the repo\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\nI would expect that the stable build would remain in sync with the highest sequence git tag (similar to the behavior of other projects -- as shown below).\r\n![screen shot 2017-08-10 at 10 45 07

It fails, and at this point I don't seem to have any way to successfully build my docs.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n- The build succeeds\r\n- The build fails, and provides me a useful error message that tells me something about the error and ideally how to resolve it.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe build failed with the following: \"Error: an unexpected error occurred\". This error message gives me nothing to work with. I can't imagine its all that useful to a developer reading reports like this either. Searching the web for this issue is also useless, since every previous report is either a case that readthedocs devs identified as some problem that's reported as solved, or some user magically figuring out their issue was some configuration issue not relevant to my project.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2985/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2985/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2983", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2983/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2983/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2983/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2983", "id": 239602128, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUyMzk2MDIxMjg=", "number": 2983, "title": "KeyError: 'exc_type'", "user": {"login": "agjohnson", "id": 1140183, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAxODM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140183?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson", "html_url": "https://github.com/agjohnson", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agjohnson/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2017-06-29T20:30:12Z", "updated_at": "2017-12-08T18:55:40Z", "closed_at": "2017-12-08T18:55:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hitting this bug when trying to update my list of GitHub projects.

Read the Docs username (if applicable): albanc\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nI just want to have the documentation display the awesome official readthedocs theme\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nI have been trying various configurations during a whole day before opening this issue, without any success.\r\n\r\nI have created a sphinx based documentation which displays nicely localy using the official RTD theme. But when I upload it to readthedocs.org (thru gitlab pulling), the documentation builds properly, but the RTD theme will never show up. It seems like there is no theme applied on the documentation.\r\n\r\n_I have tried switching the html_theme to 'default' as suggested in your doc, without success. I have also tried html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme' and I have tried regenerating a fresh conf.py using sphinx-quickstart. Same result always applies._\r\n\r\nHere is the conf.py : https://gitlab.com/mindflow/current/blob/master/docs/source/conf.py\r\n\r\nThe only specific stuff I can see in my conf.py is the following directive : \r\n\r\n> source_encoding = 'iso-8859-15' \r\n\r\nBut I assume the docs wouldn't build without it, as my accented caracters would raise many errors. Anyway it does build, but the default RTD theme won't show up. Either I am missing something trivial, or there is some bug on the server side.\r\n\r\nCould you give a hint ?

I hope this would be also acceptable).\n\nWe are rendering ReadTheDocs (RTD) documentation for a software project hosted at github (in particular, [this one](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion)).\n\nRecently we have changed our main branch due to internal policies. In the past we used \"develop\" as main branch. Now, we are unsing \"master\" as default branch. The \"develop\" branch is still in our repository, but it is not receiving new contributions (at the end, it will be deleted).\n\nThe problem is that all the links to documentation (that we have been distributing among our users during years) like this one https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/develop/user/walkthrough_apiv2/index.html will point to an obsolete piece of documentation, as now the right one is https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/walkthrough_apiv2/index.html\n\nDoes RTD have some functionality (redirect, alias, etc.) that could solve this problem? As far as I checked, RTD supports several redirection types (\"Prefix redirect\", \"Page redirect\", etc.) but after looking them all it seems they cannot do this kind of redirection (or I haven't understood how the work to do it :).

Anyway, I need to constantly wipe my environment manually and rebuild the branch in order to fix this.\n## Details\n\nYou can see that there are two build processes launched at the same time (unless I've manually launched only one process):\n\nhttps://readthedocs.org/projects/bayespy/builds/\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2179", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2179/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2179/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2179/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/2179", "id": 151914576, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWUxNTE5MTQ1NzY=", "number": 2179, "title": "could not locate conda-env", "user": {"login": "joaander", "id": 2197568, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTc1Njg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2197568?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander", "html_url": "https://github.com/joaander", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joaander/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 191510348, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTE1MTAzNDg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Operations", "name": "Operations", "color": "0052cc", "default": false, "description": "Operations or server issue"}, {"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2016-04-29T16:35:49Z", "updated_at": "2016-04-30T02:06:06Z", "closed_at": "2016-04-30T02:06:06Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "## Details\n\nIf this issue is for a specific project or build, include the following:\n- Project: hoomd-blue\n- Build # 3956594: \n\nAlso:\n- Project: gsd\n- Build # 3956602 \n\nI am attempting to configure a new project using conda to supply the environment.

[this issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-python/issues/78) in the azure storage repo, we're having an issue with read the docs.\n\nFor all the older versions everything built successfully both locally and on read the docs, and locally the html looked as expected. Looks like read the docs has some difference though and while the build succeeds, there's no actual content in the modules, like this [example](http://azure-storage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/azure.storage.blob.models.html).\n\nI've fiddled around with the advanced settings and tried with both python 2 and 3 as well as with and without virtual env. No changes.\n\nNext I tried adding azure-common to the doc requirements.txt. This worked fine locally again (no changes) but on read the docs now the [build is broken](https://readthedocs.org/projects/azure-storage/builds/3527092/).\n\nThe most info I could find online was an older issue on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14296531/what-does-error-option-single-version-externally-managed-not-recognized-ind) Since you can't specify --update in a requirements.txt as far as I know, I tried forcing to the newest version. [Build](https://readthedocs.org/projects/azure-storage/builds/3527137/) is still broken. Not much change once again.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nPS: A main clue I used to guide my fiddling was that ReadTheDocs is working fine for [azure-sdk-for-python](https://readthedocs.org/projects/azure-sdk-for-python/) which has a nearly identical configuration. I tried adding the azure-common dependency because it's needed to making the azure-storage package even valid which is why I assumed it could the problem. Still, all just guesses.

Do you get the same errors? Are you doing something differently?\n\nAlso the `gulp dev` issue about not finding `manage.py` only happens on the second save of a watched file. The first one triggers the build, the second save brings up the error above.\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1490/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1490/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1489", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1489/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1489/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1489/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1489", "id": 97417086, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU5NzQxNzA4Ng==", "number": 1489, "title": "Can not upgrade Ipython version", "user": {"login": "paugier", "id": 8842662, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDI2NjI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8842662?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier", "html_url": "https://github.com/paugier", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paugier/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 13, "created_at": "2015-07-27T08:59:10Z", "updated_at": "2015-08-20T19:19:23Z", "closed_at": "2015-08-20T16:44:18Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "Hello,\n\nI try to use readthedocs for a documentation (http://fluidlab.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which contains some ipython notebooks which need to be converted to rst.

Sorry for the bad bug report, please accept my apology.\n\nOne is, I used to mark a \"stable\" version of my \"Motor\" project by just force-pushing a tag named \"stable\". That never worked well with RTD, I tended to have to hit \"wipe\" and \"rebuild\" over and over for a while before RTD would notice the tag had moved. I hear I should've used a branch instead, that makes sense but I never tried it.\n\nRecently I heard you were doing semver, so I just deleted the \"stable\" tag and hoped RTD would parse my latest tag version (currently \"0.4.1\") instead. After waiting a few minutes to see if that would happen I gave up and just deleted and recreated the whole project.\n\nNow we've got one more caching issue. If you refresh this page a bunch: http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/changelog.html , it often still shows the changelog for version 0.4, the previous release, as if RTD remembers the old \"stable\" tag. Even though I've deleted that tag from GitHub, deleted and recreated the whole project, and repeatedly hit the \"wipe\" URL.\n\nI feel like if I force-move a tag in GitHub, wipe the build dir on RTD and rebuild, RTD should see the change. I also think that if I remove the tag, tell RTD to use semver, and build the project, RTD should parse my latest release tag and call it \"stable\". And finally, if these cache bugs mean that the only way to update RTD is to delete and recreate a project, then I think that deleting a project should clear all related caches, so that recreating the project really starts from a clean slate.\n\nThanks. =)\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1264/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1264/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1131", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1131/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1131/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1131/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1131", "id": 55302924, "node_id": "MDU6SXNzdWU1NTMwMjkyNA==", "number": 1131, "title": "matplotlib for Py3", "user": {"login": "jrkerns", "id": 4803336, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDMzMzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4803336?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrkerns", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrkerns/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 191510348, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxOTE1MTAzNDg=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Operations", "name": "Operations", "color": "0052cc", "default": false, "description": "Operations or server issue"}, {"id": 238372305, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwyMzgzNzIzMDU=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/labels/Bug", "name": "Bug", "color": "FF666E", "default": false, "description": "A bug"}], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2015-01-23T16:39:38Z", "updated_at": "2015-09-17T08:36:42Z", "closed_at": "2015-09-14T19:02:16Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "matplotlib seems to be installed for the RTD python 2.x interpreter, but not for 3.x.
